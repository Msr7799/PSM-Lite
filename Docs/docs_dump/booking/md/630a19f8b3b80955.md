# Completing the Know Your Partner (KYP) form

- Business structure.
- Full legal name as it appears on the business registration document (if the name that’s prefilled in the KYP form is incorrect, you can indicate this in the form and you’ll be directed to update your Accommodation Agreement with the correct name).
- Business registration number (if applicable).
- Name of trade register your business is registered in (if applicable).
- Registered business address (not the address of your property).
- Tax Identification Number (TIN) and issuing country
- VAT number and issuing country.
- Public contact info that's displayed on your property listings.

Depending on whether you use our payment solutions, you might also be asked to provide additional information specifically for Booking Holdings Financial Services (BHFS) in the KYP form. This information includes, but isn’t limited to:

- Details of the individual(s) who owns 25% or more of the total shares, voting rights, or other equity of the business entity (i.e. ultimate beneficial owners).
- Details of the individuals who manage and run the company (i.e. directors).

We’ll need to verify at least one person who manages or directs your business. The individuals you've identified as directors in the Know Your Partner (KYP) form will be asked to submit the following information:

- Proof of identity – depending on your location, this is usually a government ID, driver's license, or passport.
- Proof of address – this document needs to have been issued within the last six months. It can be a utility bill, credit card statement, or bank statement. You’ll need to provide the full document, but you can block out sensitive information such as utility costs, bank account numbers, balances, and transactions.

If you enabled Payments by Booking.com with bank transfer payouts, you’ll need to provide your bank account details to comply with regulatory requirements and to receive payouts for your reservations.

## FAQs

-
If you’ve already completed the KYP form but are still receiving reminders, it could be because your properties are listed under multiple legal entities, each with its own Legal Entity ID number. Each legal entity is required to have its own KYP form. Submit the remaining forms for any other entities, or use your primary account to update your portfolio by moving all properties to a single legal entity.

-
If you need to update any of the information in the Know Your Partner (KYP) form after initial verification failure, you can do this by opening up the KYP form in the Extranet’s Compliance center or by clicking on the link in the emails you receive from us about this.

-
If your property is still active on our site, we’re required to ask you to complete the KYP form even if you haven’t added any availability.

If you want to remove your property or end your partnership with us, you can follow the steps in this article.
