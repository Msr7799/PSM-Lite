# Paying your invoices

We email our commission invoices to all partners the first week of every month. This invoice reflects the commission for all reservations completed during the previous month. Other than the commission invoice, you might also receive the following invoice types: customer complaint invoices, incorrect reporting invoices, debit notes, and credit notes. Additional invoices are issued throughout the month.

**Understanding your invoices**

Commission invoices are posted in the Extranet’s **Finance **menu on the **Invoices** page. They’re also emailed to the address found in **Account settings**.

Your property is invoiced for all reservations completed in the previous month. If a guest doesn’t show up for their booking, you have 48 hours after check-out to mark them as a no-show to avoid being invoiced for the booking. Read more about what reservations are included in your invoices.

Note: Partners from certain areas might receive invoices for VAT/GST in a separate document.

Additional invoices are posted on the Extranet via **Invoices** under the **Finance **menu, and are issued throughout the month. We recommend you check the **Invoices** page at least every two weeks.

**Paying your invoices**

Paying your invoice can differ based on your selected payment method on the Extranet. The three main ways of paying invoices are:

- Direct debit – payment will be directly debited from the account you provided in
**Bank details**, under the**Finance**menu**.**Invoices will be marked as paid on the day we send the payment request to your bank. If the direct debit fails, the invoice will appear overdue. The invoice will then have to be paid via bank transfer. You can find our bank details by following these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to the
**Finance**menu - Select the
**Financial overview**option, then**Payment information**

To check why the payment failed, contact your bank.

- Bank transfer – our bank details are included in the invoice, under the due date. Don’t forget to include your property ID and invoice number
as the payment reference – they’re necessary for us to identify your payment and process it correctly. - Online payment or payment option through a payment service provider (PSP) – this is available for some partners depending on location. If this method is available for you, you’ll need to follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet and go to the
**Finance**menu - Select the invoice you want to pay under
**Invoices** - Click the button available for the selected invoice

If you’re both based and operating in Brazil, there are two additional ways of paying your invoices:

- Boleto – you can pay your invoice through this bank document with a barcode. Go to
**Invoices**under the**Finance**menu and find the document that says**Commission**. Underneath, you’ll find a**Boleto**link. - QR Code Pix – go to the
**Invoices**option under**Finance**and select the invoices you want to pay, including any available credit notes. Click**Proceed to payment**, then**Continue to Pix**. Open your mobile banking app with your registered Pix key and choose**Pay with Pix**. Scan or copy and paste the QR code. You’ll have up to 15 minutes to complete the payment. If you start the payment and leave the screen, you’ll need to wait 15 minutes to generate a new QR code.

Find the payment methods available globally under **Finance** in the **Financial overview **option, under **Payment information**.

All invoices contain the payment steps you need to follow and whether any payment needs to be made under the Payment Due date.

Stripe Users, Hybrid BT, and Hybrid 2.0 BT receive an invoice with the gross amount of the reservations. A separate commission invoice will be issued, and then payment is due to Booking.com.

It can take approximately seven business days for received payments to reflect on the Extranet, so an invoice may stay marked as unpaid/overdue for a few days after you’ve paid it. You don’t need to send us proof of payment unless our Finance team asks for it, or in the event of a double invoice payment – in which case, reach out to Credit Control with proof of payment. You can also contact Credit Control to check the current balance in case of a short or overpayment.

**Checking or updating your current payment method**

To check your current payment method and bank details, sign in to the Extranet, click **Finance**, and select **Bank details **or** Financial settings**. You’ll be able to see the details of the bank account where you receive payouts, and if you pay by direct debit, the bank account from which you make payments.

If you make your payments via direct debit, you can update your current payment method or bank details by following these instructions:*

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Click the
**Finance**menu and select either**Bank details**or**Financial settings** - Click
**Edit bank details**

For any questions about your payment method, message us via the Extranet **inbox**. Select **Invoices and commission**, then **Other**. An agent will get back to you with information on payment methods available in your country, such as direct debit, online payments, or local payment providers.

**This isn’t possible for those in Slovenia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Denmark, or Norway – in which case, there are forms available on the Extranet.*

**Changing your invoicing language**

Your invoices and other financial documents are generated based on the language setting of either your invoicing contact or your primary point of contact.

To change the language of your financial documents:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click the
**account**icon on the top right corner of the page, then choose**Contacts.** - If you have a contact for
**Invoices**, click**Edit**and change the language. Click**Save changes**. - If you don’t have a contact for
**Invoices**, click**Edit**under**Primary point of contact**and change the language. Click**Save changes.**

Keep in mind that the new language setting will be applied only to documents generated in the future. Existing documents will stay the same.

**Corrections to your invoice**

If we send you an invoice with the wrong amount, we won’t send a new invoice. The original invoice will remain valid and we’ll issue a separate document with the amount to be deducted or added to the original invoice. This will either be a credit note or a debit note.

Keep in mind that credit notes can’t be refunded to your bank account – you can use them to pay future invoices. Read more on how credit notes work. If you receive a debit note, follow the instructions specified in it.

If you accidentally pay the same invoice twice or the wrong amount, the extra amount will be deducted from your next invoice. If you’d rather receive a refund, message us.

**Status of your invoice**

When checking the status of your invoices, you’ll see one of the following labels:

**Paid**–the invoice has been paid in full.**Due by month/day/year**–the invoice hasn’t been paid yet and is due for payment. Unpaid (or due) invoices are visible under**Outstanding balances**.**Overdue (due by month/day/year)**– the invoice is overdue and may lead to account suspension from our platform if not paid.

**You’ve paid X of X** – you’ve only paid part of your invoice. Or, if you requested to use a credit note for an invoice – you’ll also see the remaining balance under **Total amount due.** Make sure the invoice is paid in full by its due date.

**Written off **– because you didn’t pay on time, your property was permanently closed on our platform. Once we receive full payment for all outstanding invoices and they’re marked as **Paid**, you’ll be able to reopen your property listing or discuss reopening conditions.
