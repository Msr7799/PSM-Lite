## FAQs

-
If your .ics link isn't working, here are a few steps to try:

- Double-check the link for accuracy.
- Ensure your third-party calendar supports .ics links.
- Wait a moment and try syncing again, as it can take up to two hours for updates to refresh.

-
No, we currently do not have a sync option for Google Calendar.

-
Calendars aren’t synced in real time and can take up to two hours to refresh, so individual bookings and reservations made on other platforms won’t sync immediately with your Booking.com calendar, and vice versa.

-
First, check your .ics link to make sure it’s formatted correctly. If the problem persists, try reconnecting. Also, check the connection settings on the other OTA.

-
Yes, just navigate to the

**Sync calendars**page, find the calendar you want to remove, click**Remove**, and confirm your choice. -
Even though the calendar sync updates your availability across platforms, it doesn’t happen in real time. This means reservations made on other platforms might not sync right away, which can lead to double bookings. While this is rare, if it does happen, contact our team for support.
