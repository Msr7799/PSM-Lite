# Updating your rates and availability

You can increase your visibility in search results and attract early bookers by loading rates and availability well in advance. You can update your rates and availability via your calendar on the Extranet, either in the list or monthly view. Be sure to load prices for any dates you’ve opened, so potential guests can see and book those rooms or units. Travelers can book up to 16 months in advance.

Reminder – your rates may not be displayed in the currency of your choice. The currency is set up on the Extranet as a default option and can’t be switched because of internal processes related to payments and billings.

**Updating your rates and availability in list view**

If you're viewing your calendar in list view, follow these steps to update your rates and availability:

- Log in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Rates & Availability**and then on**Calendar**. - Find the room or unit type you’d like to update availability for, then adjust how many of them you want to sell and on which dates in the
**Rooms to sell**row. - You can then edit the price for that room type in the
**Rate plan**row. **To make changes for multiple days at once**, click a cell and drag the blue slider across all the dates you want to apply the change to. Add the number of rooms or units and the price per night in the pop-up box that appears, then click**Save**.**To make changes for more than one month at once**, click**Bulk edit**for the room or unit type you want to update. In the panel that appears, select how many rooms or units you’d like to sell on which dates and for what price, then click**Save changes**.**To make changes for multiple room or unit types at once**, click**Bulk edit**, then select**Multiple room types**when the panel appears. Adjust the number of rooms or units to sell for the ones you want to update, then click**Save changes**.

Note: It may take a few minutes to see your availability refreshed on the platform. If you’re working with a connectivity provider, factor in possible delays from the provider.

If you work with a connectivity provider, you may not be able to use the Bulk edit option in the Extranet calendar view. In some instances, if you’re using a PMS or channel manager, you might be able to use the Bulk edit function, but your connectivity provider will override calendar changes the next time it syncs. Use your connectivity provider’s software to update your property’s availability on our platform. Read this article to learn how to manage your availability through your connectivity provider.

**Updating your rates and availability in monthly view**

If you're viewing your calendar in monthly view, follow these steps to update your rates and availability: Keep in mind that the monthly view isn’t always available to partners using a channel manager.

- Log in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Rates & Availability**and then on**Calendar**. - In the drop-down menu, select the room or unit you’d like to update.
- Select the date or date range that you’d like to update by clicking and dragging the slider in the calendar, or by selecting the
**Start date**and**End date**in the panel. Click the**Advanced date selection**drop-down if you’d like to specify which weekdays you’d like the changes to apply to. - In the panel, specify the number of rooms or units you’d like to sell for that room or unit type, which Rate Plans apply, how much you’ll charge, and whether it’s non-refundable (this option is available to properties that only have one Rate Plan). You can also add or adjust restrictions to your Rate Plans here.
- To be available for travelers to book, make sure the days you’re applying the rates to also have rooms or units marked
**Open**for bookings. - Scroll down and click
**Save**to apply the changes.

Note: It may take a few minutes to see your availability refreshed on the platform.

**Checking if your property is open and bookable**

You can check the Extranet calendar to see when your property is available to book and when it isn’t. You can also see this info on the Pulse app. Different colors indicate the status of your rooms or units:

**Green**–your room or unit is open and available to book on that date**Red**– your room or unit isn’t available to book on that date

There are several reasons for a room or unit not being available to book. You’ll see one of these reasons in the red badge under the name of the room or unit in your list view calendar:

**Closed**– you closed this room or unit. If using Pulse, you can make it open and bookable again by switching the toggle to the right. To do this on the Extranet calendar, click the**Rooms to sell**row – the room should automatically turn from red to green.**No inventory**– you haven’t added any inventory to your rooms or units yet or you’ve reduced your inventory to**0**. To make it open and bookable again, add inventory.**Price missing**– you haven’t added a price to your Rate Plan. To make your room or unit open and bookable again, add at least one price to a Rate Plan attached to this room or unit.**Rate closed**– your Rate Plans for that date are closed. To make your room or unit open and bookable again, open at least one Rate Plan that’s attached to this room or unit.**Multiple blockers**– a combination of issues is preventing your room or unit from being bookable. Click the**Rooms to sell**row to see exactly which issues need to be addressed.**Sold out**– the rooms or units you’re selling on our platform have all been booked for that date. If you have more availability and want to become open and bookable again, add availability to a room or unit.**Fully booked**– all your rooms or units have been booked for that date (this only applies to the Pulse app).

If your property doesn’t appear on the search page, make sure your rooms and units:

- Were added to your inventory
- Are open for bookings
- Have open rate plans set up
- Have a price added to each rate plan

Remember – to specify how much you want to charge for reservations, you need to add the price in your Extranet calendar for each date and room type in the **Rate plan** row.

It’s also possible that the restrictions you’ve set are affecting your property’s visibility on our platform. For example, when you only accept bookings for a minimum number of nights, your property won’t appear in search results for fewer nights than your set minimum. Also, if your minimum length of stay restriction is higher than the number of consecutive days you have available, you won’t appear in the search results.
