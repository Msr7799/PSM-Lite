On your Extranet's

**Reservations**page, check the “Status” column of the reservation for a label showing “**Payment via Booking.com**.”This means Booking.com facilitates the guest’s payment, but please note that it doesn’t confirm when funds have been collected or transferred to your account.

-
Yes. Guests can have the option to pay online:

- By choosing to pay online (“Pay now” button) in the post-booking section – only available in some markets
- By choosing to pay online (“Pay now” button) – available for guests who had their credit card marked as invalid. This option is part of the invalid credit card process and will appear next to the option to update credit card details.

**Here’s how you’ll be informed that your guests paid online:**- You’ll get an email letting you know a modification was made and we collected the payment.
- The reservation page on the Extranet will be updated. Once the reservation is paid, you won’t be able to cancel it.
- The reservation details will be updated and appear as “Paid online.”
- Any mention of an invalid credit card will be removed from the reservation.

-
When a guest pays online, they receive a payment confirmation by email.

-
Check the Extranet to see if there are any banners or notifications about a payout delay. If there's no indication of a delay, send us a message through your

**Inbox**with the topic "Receiving my payouts." -
If your property is active on Payments by Booking.com and located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, or New Zealand, we manage payments for all reservations where guests pay in advance. To set up your payments service so that all your payments are managed by us online, you just need to add prepayment to all your available policies.

To do this, sign in to the Extranet, click the

**Property**menu, then**Policies**, and edit your policies to include prepayment.

Note: In some rare cases (e.g. reservations we receive through some third-party channels), we’re unable to charge guests, so your property might receive reservations with guest credit card details instead. -

If you’re having issues seeing this info, contact your connectivity partner and ask them about these features:

**Extra information about the reservation (res_extra_info):**This feature allows your channel manager or PMS to indicate which reservation payments are facilitated by us.**Payments Clarity Package:**This feature lets you see your virtual credit cards’ balances, activations, and expiration dates in your channel manager or PMS.

We charge guests based on your policies and guarantee that guests will have paid in full before they arrive at your property. If the credit card info a guest provides is invalid—and they don’t update it or provide valid card info within 24 hours—we’ll automatically cancel the reservation. We won’t charge you commission for that booking if this happens.

-
You can see which payment method we’ll use for each booking under the

**Price**column on the Extranet’s**Reservations**page. You can also see the details of the payment method in the**Payment details**section on the**Reservation details**page for each booking. -
We include extra fees and charges in the amount we collect from guests when they pay online. The exception is for amounts broken down per person and that you’ve set to “excluded” on the Extranet. You’ll need to charge guests for these amounts yourself. You can see the breakdown of charges for each booking on the Extranet’s

**Reservation details**page. -
You can either decide to manage the damage deposits yourself or let us facilitate them on your behalf at no additional cost. Learn more about setting up damage policy options in this article.

-
You need to provide your guests with an invoice when they check out. This is because the reservation agreement is a direct transaction between you and your guest, not with Booking.com. You can provide the invoice on paper, by email, or both.

Here’s some more important information about invoices:

- We hold no responsibility for invoicing, and we don’t send invoices for any reservation to you or your guest.
- Make sure you issue invoices in your guest’s name, or another name you’ve agreed with them.
- For payouts you receive by VCC, the cardholder name will always be
**Booking.com (Agent).** - When we charge a guest, there may be tax implications for you. To learn more about local taxes, take a look at this article.
- You can export your invoices to use for tax declarations or other record keeping purposes.

For more information about invoices, take a look at this article.

-
When a guest uses a Booking Sponsored Benefit, we’ll cover a portion of the price so that the guest pays less. However, you should still provide them with an invoice for the full price. If a guest needs the documentation for tax or reimbursement purposes, then they should submit the receipt from you and the booking confirmation from us, which indicates the discount.

-
If you decide to refund a guest and we haven’t paid you for the reservation, we just won’t transfer the payout to you. Instead of paying you, we’ll refund the guest on your behalf.

If we’ve already paid you for the booking by bank transfer, we’ll deduct the amount we refund the guest from your next payout via bank transfer. If you’re not due to receive a payout at that time, you’ll need to pay us the amount we refunded to the guest. We’ll send you a debit note to let you know about this.

If we’ve already paid you for the booking using a virtual credit card—and you’ve already charged the VCC—you’ll need to refund it. To learn more about refunding VCCs, take a look at this article. If you haven’t charged the virtual credit card yet, you don’t need to do anything.

-
Yes, all properties using Payments by Booking.com can be booked with Wallet Credits. If your property doesn’t use Payments by Booking.com, you’ll need to opt in to be booked with Wallet Credits.

-
Payments by Booking.com is available only in a number of countries.

## Getting paid by virtual credit card (VCC)

-
A virtual credit card (VCC) is a temporary digital Mastercard linked to an existing credit card. It functions like a regular credit card and helps guests make secure online payments.

Here’s what you need to know about charging VCCs:

- For every relevant booking you receive, we’ll send you a new VCC.
- As long as each VCC stays active, you can charge it as many times as you like until the balance reaches zero.
- Each VCC has an activation date that's determined by whether the booking is refundable or not.

Find more info on VCCs here.

-
Here’s how to charge a VCC for a reservation that the guest paid for online:

- Sign in to the Extranet and click the
**Reservations**menu - Click the guest’s name or reservation number to view the
**Reservation details**page - Click
**View credit card details** - Enter the VCC details using your Point of Sale (POS) machine
- Charge the available
amount displayed

For a more detailed explanation of how to charge VCCs, watch this tutorial. If you use a channel manager or property management system (PMS), learn more about charging VCCs in this article.

- Sign in to the Extranet and click the
-
If something goes wrong when you try to charge a virtual credit card (VCC), you’ll be able to see the reason on the

**Reservations details**page about 30 minutes later. You can find some of the most common issues with charging VCCs in this article. -
If you receive a cancellation, no-show, or modification and are owed money, we’ll send you an email with updated virtual credit card (VCC) details.

-
If you’ve already charged a virtual credit card (VCC), there are two situations when you may need to refund it:

- You or your guest cancel or modify a booking or the guest doesn’t show up, and you agree to waive any fees that would apply.
- A reservation is canceled due to Force Majeure. In these cases, guests shouldn’t be charged for stays they can’t make and we waive commission on the affected reservations.

In both cases, we’ll refund the guest, and you’ll need to refund the same VCC you originally charged. To learn how to do this, take a look at this article.

-
When a guest makes a booking and pays for it online, we’ll send you a virtual credit card (VCC) along with the booking details. This card gives you access to the exact amount for that booking, and you can charge the virtual card as you would any credit card. Just make sure you do this after it's activated.

-
If you meet the following criteria, you can charge VCCs as soon as the reservation becomes non-refundable:

- You’ve paid your invoices on time for the last 12 months, according to the payment due dates
- You’ve been working with us for at least six months and have validated guest stays and reviews

We'll notify you by email if you qualify to charge your virtual credit cards before check-in.

We’ll review whether or not you meet these criteria every four months and will email you if anything changes.If you don’t meet the criteria during our review, then you can charge the VCCs one day after check-in, or at check-in for US properties. -
We’ll send you an email once a VCC is activated. You’ll have 365 days after the check-out date to charge the VCC. After that, the funds will belong to us because they’ll be considered financial breakage (i.e. revenue from services that were paid for but not used).

We’ll email you a weekly summary showing VCCs from check-outs in the last week with open balances. This isn’t a cumulative report on all uncharged VCCs – only about the previous week’s. You’ll be able to see the transaction details on the Extranet for 547 days (18 months) after the check-out date.

-
If you’re asked to enter a zip code when charging a virtual credit card (VCC), you can use the guest’s or your own zip code.

-
Your payment service provider will generally charge a fee between 2% and 3% for facilitating each transaction. The exact amount you’re charged may depend on local laws and any additional fees your bank may charge. For more information, contact your payment service provider.

-
Exchange rates don’t affect your payments if you've set the price of your rooms in the same currency you use to charge virtual credit cards (VCC).

If you receive a VCC in one currency but charge it in another, Mastercard will convert the amount using its own exchange rate. You can find out what this is on the Mastercard website.

-
You’ll pay commission for these bookings the same way as other bookings. Each payment you receive by virtual credit card (VCC) will be for the total gross amount of the booking. When we email you the VCC details, we’ll include a breakdown of the amount you’ve been paid. We’ll also invoice you separately for your commission fees.

If you’re eligible, here’s how you can switch from Virtual Credit Card to Bank Transfer:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Finance**, then**Finance settings.** - Click
**Payout method**and**edit payout method,**then follow the steps to proceed with the switch.

We currently only offer the option to switch from virtual credit card to bank transfer. We’re still working on introducing the switch from bank transfer to virtual credit card. If the option isn’t available on the Extranet, you can’t switch payout methods.

When you request a payout method switch, it will take five days to process. New reservations during that period will be moved to bank transfer – you’ll be informed through the Extranet if the switch fails.

This depends on the payment schedule you've set up and your bank. It can take a few days before the payment reaches your account.

**If you’re set up for monthly payments,**we’ll process payments by the 15th day of the month after the guest checks out.**If you’re set up for weekly payments,**we’ll process payments every Thursday for reservations where the guest checked out during the previous week, which runs from Thursday until Wednesday. If the Thursday when we'd usually process your payment is a public holiday, we’ll process it on the next business day.**If you’re set up for daily payments**, we’ll process payments one day after check-out. We don’t process payments on weekends and public holidays. Note: At the moment, the possibility to have daily payments is limited to select countries. We’re working toward expanding this feature to more countries.

To check or change your payment schedule, sign in to the Extranet, click on the

**Finance**menu, and select**Finance settings**and then**Payout timing**to select your preferred payout schedule. -

- Click

-
Depending on the country you’re in and payment model you’re using, your payment will either be gross or net.

If you receive a gross payout, we’ll pay you the total amount of your reservations. We’ll then invoice you for commission normally. Your commission invoice will include all bookings from the previous period, including any bookings that weren’t paid for online.

If you receive a net payout, we’ll pay you the total amount of your reservations minus the total amount of all your invoices. You won’t have to pay commission separately.

-
Here’s how to change the bank details we use to pay you:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Go to the
**Finance**menuand then click on**Finance settings**. - Under
**Receiving payouts from Booking.com**, click**Add bank details**or**Edit bank details**. - Enter your new bank details.
- Click “Update bank details.”

It can take up to five business days for your bank details to update in our system. If you change your bank details again while they’re updating, the update time resets back to five days.

Once the bank details are updated and confirmed, the next payout will be sent to your bank account according to your selected payout timing – daily, weekly, or monthly. To learn more about updating your bank details, watch this tutorial.

-
To list a property on Payments by Booking.com with a foreign bank account, you can’t accept credit card payments and have your property listed in a country that belongs to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). For countries outside of SEPA, the bank account has to be located in the same country as the property is listed.

-
Exchange rates don’t affect your payments if you set the price of your rooms in the same currency as we make your bank transfer payment in. If the currency you set your rooms in isn’t the same as the one we make your bank transfer payment in, we’ll convert the amount using the rate of a third-party service provider the day before we send your remittance advice.

If we make your bank transfer payment in a different currency from the one of your bank account, your bank will convert the amount using their own exchange rate. To find out what this is, contact your bank directly.

To find out which currency we’ll make your bank transfer payment in, check the payout document we email you each month. To download these payout documents, follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to
**Finance****,**then**Payout information** - Click on the arrow next to the period you’re interested in seeing a list of reservations for
- Click
**PDF**or**CSV**to download the payout document

-
The total amount shown on your invoice only includes amounts we charge commission on, such as room rates. The total reservation amount on your remittance advice is the total amount we’ve collected from guests on your behalf. This includes room or unit rates plus any additional fees, unless they’ve been broken down per person and you’ve set them as

**excluded**on the Extranet. We don’t charge you commission for these excluded fees. -
If the amount of your commission invoice is higher than the amount we pay you by bank transfer, we’ll collect the difference from your bank account. We need you to set up Direct Debit to allow us to do this unless Direct Debits aren’t available in your country.

To learn more about paying your commission invoice by Direct Debit, check out this article.

-
Depending on your property’s location and settings, we only offer the option to switch from Virtual credit card to Bank transfer at this point (see VCC section). We’re working on introducing the switch from Bank transfer to Virtual credit card – we’ll inform you when it becomes available in your market.
