# Connect your Agoda calendar with other websites

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006604248-Connect-your-Agoda-calendar-with-other-websites

Updated: 2025-05-14T07:53:17Z

Connecting your calendars across all the websites where you list your property can easily help you prevent overbookings. In the Agoda extranet, you can fully connect your calendars by exporting your Agoda calendar to other websites and importing their calendar. This way, when your property is booked on one site, the dates will automatically be blocked on the other.

###
**Fully connect the Agoda calendar with other websites** ** **

**Desktop and Agoda app **

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to
**Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.
- Click
**Connect calendars**.
- For the website you want to connect calendars with:
- Copy your Agoda calendar link and paste it into the calendar connection feature of the other website.
- Get the calendar link of the other website and paste it into the
*Other website link* field.
- Name the calendar and click
**Import**.

- Repeat the process for the other websites you want to connect with.

**Managing calendar connections**

You can view and manage your calendar connections at any time in the Agoda extranet by navigating to **Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.

**Edit or remove a calendar connection** ** **

**Desktop and Agoda app **

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to
**Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.
- For the calendar connection you want to manage:
- Click to edit the connection.
- Click to stop exporting your Agoda calendar. To stop importing the other website’s calendar, visit their website to manage the connection.


**Refreshing calendar connections**

Calendar connections automatically refresh several times a day. You can see when the calendar was last refreshed on the Calendar connections page, and you can refresh all connections at once to ensure availability is up to date.

**Desktop and Agoda app**

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to
**Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.

# Clarification on Reference Sell-Rate Loading and Commission Changes: Agoda Homes

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17333710858515-Clarification-on-Reference-Sell-Rate-Loading-and-Commission-Changes-Agoda-Homes

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:12:15Z

As a valued partner, we believe it's crucial to keep you informed about Agoda’s operational changes on rate loading and commission changes that can directly impact our collaboration and mutual success. Therefore, we would like to provide more information on Reference Sell Rate loading and changes to commission and explain how these changes impact you.

Reference Sell Rate loading means that you load the reference rate that your property will be offered to the bookers. Agoda will collect from bookers, deduct its commission and remit the difference to you.

Note that there is no change in the amount the booker will pay and the amount that Agoda will remit to you, but instead of Agoda calculating the rate on your behalf taking into account Agoda commission, now the rate will be directly provided by you.

This means that you will receive the Reference Sell Rate that you have loaded minus Agoda commission and Tax on it (if applicable). We will remit the difference to you.

In addition, effective September 2023, we will deduct the following commission percentages from the total amount paid by bookers.


After the Reference Sell-rate loading apply, you can see applicable commission in the system by means:

go to Host Manage --> Booking & Earning --> View Commission

**How is the total amount calculated?**

Reference Sell Rate - % Commission - Tax* = Base Rate that you will receive

*If applicable Agoda will apply VAT/GST/sales tax on the commission charged to your property.

Tax = Commission x % Tax on commission


For example:

Below are sample calculations of the Base Rate received by property in Indonesia

Sample A : without promotion and rate channel setup

Sample B : with promotion and rate channel setup

To understand how to calculate your own rates, please access our rate calculation tool attached. This file is a templated spreadsheet allowing you to input relevant data and obtain your calculated rates quickly.

Step 1: Access your Host Manage account and choose the Payment Accounts tab from one of your properties.

Step 2: Locate and click the button marked “View Account.”

Step 3: You will be directed to the bank account setup page. Click the “Create” button to proceed.

Step 4: Fill in required information (varies by country) and upload your bank account supporting documentation on the bottom right.

For detailed instructions of bank account setup, please refer to: How do I Set Up my Bank Account? - Agoda Partner Hub

Step 5: Wait for the Agoda Finance team to review your bank accounts.

If the status shows “Pending” for more than 5 business days, please send a follow-up email to biz@agoda.com, mentioning "Follow up" in your email subject line. If the status changes to “Rejected,” the Finance team will reach out to you with the rejection reason by email. Once your bank account status is changed to “Approved” you can move on to the next step.

Step 6: Follow Step. 1~Step.4 in the section “**If you already have some properties with approved bank:”**


Note: Now we can replicate an approved bank account to all your properties! If you want to collect payment by multiple bank accounts, please set up an approved bank account for one of the respective properties and contact Agoda Service Team to support bank account cloning.

# The Sharing Economy Reporting Regime (SERR) Australia

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29424036832275-The-Sharing-Economy-Reporting-Regime-SERR-Australia

Updated: 2025-01-22T10:21:35Z

As a result of the new Sharing Economy Reporting Regime (SERR), Agoda Company Pte Ltd ("Agoda") has a legal obligation to report information about our partners with properties in Australia to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In this article you’ll find everything you need to know about SERR.


SERR is a third-party reporting system that requires operators of electronic distribution platforms (EDP) to collect, verify, and report seller transactions to the ATO.

As Agoda operates in Australia and is considered an EDP, we’re obligated to collect, verify, and report tax information about certain qualifying partners that conduct business through our platform, as well as business transactions made via our platform by those partners. The data collected for SERR will be reported to the Australian Taxation Office bi-annually before 31 January and 31 July every year.


Partners with properties located in Australia or any of its external territories* are within the scope of SERR, irrespective of whether their primary address is within or outside of Australia.

*External territories of Australia:

All partners with properties located in Australia or one of its external territories and listing on our platform will be requested to complete the Tax Compliance Information form to comply with the SERR reporting requirements. Please ensure that the information is always correct and updated.

How to access the Tax Compliance Information Form:


In the Tax Compliance Information Form, you will need to indicate your business type/structure with the following criteria in mind:

You will also provide personal/business details, address, and other individual/business tax details. You will need the following:

The SERR implementation guideline also requires other mandatory information such as the “Financial Account Reference.”

This Financial Account Reference, as defined in the guideline, refers to the account number to which the payment was made, or the most recent bank account used on the seller’s (partner) record. This will be either your bank account number, International Account Identifier, or Online Account Identifier.

When payments are made to more than one account within a reporting period, this reference indicates which bank account was most recently used.

Regardless of the method by which you receive payments from Agoda, you are required to provide the Financial Account Reference mentioned above.

For more information on mandatory information/fields you are required to provide, you may refer to the full text of the SERR Implementation Guide which the ATO regularly updates here: https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/sharingeconomytaxablepaymentsspecification


We will send regular reminders for partners to complete the form and provide the required details.


Once you’ve submitted your Tax Compliance Information form (the "Form"), we will validate certain data points per the guidance of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Please note that the data you provide in this Form will be used only for Australia's Sharing Economy Reporting Regime ("SERR") reporting purposes. Any similar information that you may have or will provide to Agoda through any channels will not be automatically updated by the information collected through this Form. Conversely, the information that you may have or will provide to Agoda through any channels will not be reflected in this Form.


Please note that data about you will be submitted to the ATO and in case the data is not complete or incorrect, this might result in an audit or further requests from the ATO to you.

In this article, you will find information on how to update your Touristic Rental of Residence permit number in YCS.

On 1 January 2024, Law no. 7464 on short term rentals took effect in the Republic of Türkiye.

This law requires partners renting entire residential properties for less than 100 nights to obtain a Permit Certificate for Touristic Rental of Residence from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (“Konutun Turizm Amaçlı Kiralanmasına Ilişkin İzin Belgesi”).

We highly recommend you refer to the full text of Law n. 7464 here: https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2023/11/20231102-16.htm

To comply with Law no. 7464, you are required to provide Agoda with your permit number or alternatively confirm that you are exempted from obtaining a permit in order to continue using our services.


You may provide this information on Host Manage by following these steps:

If you do not provide your permit number to Agoda or alternatively confirm that you are exempted from obtaining a permit, we will remove your listing from our platform until we receive your permit number or confirmation of exemption.

# Agoda DAC7 FAQ Page

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31614803968659-Agoda-DAC7-FAQ-Page

Updated: 2025-01-22T10:25:12Z

DAC7 is an EU law aiming to improve tax cooperation between EU member states – including transparency on revenues earned by sellers through digital platforms. This law will simplify the collection of taxes by local tax authorities. As part of this, Agoda Company Pte Ltd (“Agoda”) has to report information about our partners—both business entities and individuals conducting business through our platform and business transactions executed via our platform—to the Dutch tax authorities (DTA). The DTA will then share this info with the tax authorities from other EU member states.


**Will anything change in how taxes are processed due to DAC7 data reporting obligations?**

DAC7 doesn’t require any changes in the way taxes are processed, neither for the commission charged by Agoda nor for local taxes you charge guests. At the same time, we expect local tax authorities will use data provided by platforms to evaluate the validity and completeness of your taxes. They may also pre-fill parts of your tax return based on the data received from Agoda.


All partners with EU-based property listing on our platform will be requested to complete the Tax Compliance Information form to comply with the DAC7 reporting requirements. Please ensure that the information is always correct and updated.

You may refer to the Glossary of Terms at the end of this page.


**How to access the Tax Compliance Information Form**

DAC7 is an annual reporting obligation effective for the reporting period 2023 calendar year. The DAC7 collected data will be reported to the Dutch Tax Authorities by January 31 following the reporting year. For example, we’ll report data by 31 January 2024 for the 2023 calendar year, 31 January 2025 for the 2024 reporting year, and so on.


**Where can I find my business registration number, Tax Identification Number (TIN), and Value-Add Tax (VAT) numbers?**

As a party conducting business via Agoda, you must report the following numbers.

**For an entity:**

**For an individual** conducting business through our platform and considered a business by Agoda from a tax perspective:

We recommend contacting your accountant or local tax advisor if you’re unsure where to find these specific numbers.


**As a partner who manages multiple properties, do I need to provide data for every property?**

In general, you have to provide data about the individual or company authorized to bind your property named/specified in Agoda’s extranet/platform in the Tax Compliance Information form.

If you are a host (non-hotel accommodation) with multiple properties listed on Agoda under the same Member ID, then you need to provide the information only once for any one of your properties. Agoda will then use the same information for reporting purposes for all the properties tagged under that Member ID. If you input information for multiple properties under the same member ID, Agoda will only use the latest information which was entered during the reporting period.


**What if I have properties both within and outside the EU?**

If you have any properties within the EU listed on Agoda, you’ll fall into the scope of DAC7, and we’ll notify you to update the Tax Compliance Information form, whether or not your property is open for bookings.

To provide you ample time, you have 90 days from the date of our notification to update the Tax Compliance Information form. After the initial notification, we’ll send you two additional reminders to complete the form.

Please note that we will send the notification for each property, and we ask for your kind cooperation to complete the Tax Compliance Information form for each property.


**I don’t own the property. I only manage it on Agoda. Do I need to provide my data?**

For DAC7 purposes, we collect data about the individual or company with whom we’ve signed contracts with. Thus, if you agreed to our General Terms and Conditions, we still need you to complete the Tax Compliance Information form with the details of the individual or company who signed the contracts for the property listing.


**Will you share my information? And if so, with whom?**

Yes. Agoda has to report information about partners (i.e. business entities and individuals conducting business through our platform, as well as business transactions executed via our platform) to the Dutch Tax Authorities (DTA). The DTA will in turn share this information with the tax authorities from other EU Member States.


**If I remove my property from Agoda, will my information still be shared?**

We must share all data about our partners who make transactions via Agoda with the Dutch Tax Authorities. If you made transactions within a reporting year and decided to close the property for bookings, your data will still be shared with the Dutch Tax Authorities for DAC7 purposes unless you fall under one of the following exemptions:

**What happens if I don’t share my data?**

Under DAC7 enforcement rules for non-compliant partners, where the Seller does not provide the required information after two reminders following the initial notification by the Platform, but no earlier than 60 days from notification date, the Platform is obliged to take certain actions which may include closing the account, preventing re-registration on the platform, or withholding payment until the required information is provided.

Thus, as noted above, we provide you 60 days from notification date to complete the Tax Compliance Information Form, with two additional reminders. If the form is not completed within this timeframe, your EU-based properties may either be temporarily suspended and/or payment to you may be withheld. You’ll still have to honor any existing reservations.

We encourage you to complete the Tax Compliance Information Form for your EU-based property as soon as possible to avoid temporary suspension from the platform and/or the withholding of payments. Please note that in cases where we have withheld payment due to an incomplete EU DAC7 Tax Compliance Information Form, we will resume payment upon completion of this form. Please allow up to 24 hours for the system to be updated.


**How would my data be processed?**

For more info on how we process your personal data, please read our privacy notices:


**Entity:** legal person or legal arrangement, such as a corporation, partnership, trust or foundation. An entity is a related entity of another entity, if either entity controls the other entity, or the two entities are under common control.

# Why does my bank account status show as “Pending”?

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000118388-Why-does-my-bank-account-status-show-as-Pending

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:12:11Z

If your current payout method is selected as **Direct deposit to bank** and your bank account status is “pending,” it’s because the account has not been reviewed by our finance team yet.

Agoda finance will need to verify your bank account information before sending you a payout. This is to ensure we avoid sending money to the wrong account -- and we only need to verify it once. Once you have filled in your bank details, please provide supporting documents to help our Finance team to review your bank accounts by attaching documents in Host Manage.

**Documents required:**

A. For Personal bank account

B. For Corporate bank account

**Remark:**

If you would like to change bank account, please provide previous bank supporting document or contract/termination letter/ownership transfer between you and the previous owner or a document that shows linkage with the property.

You can expect to hear back from us – either approving the bank account details or requesting additional documents – within 2 business days.

If you have multiple properties, please make sure to set up bank account details for every property. If you do not receive any update from us regarding the verification of your bank account within 2-3 business days, please send a follow-up email to biz@agoda.com mentioning "Follow up - Bank Approval_[your property ID]_[your property name]” in the subject line. Please ensure that the title of your email is correct to avoid any delay.

# Japan Agoda Homes License

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001002608-Japan-Agoda-Homes-License

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:20:28Z

The nation of Japan requires a license in order to rent out your home. Below are answers to frequently asked questions, but we also highly recommend that you visit the Japan Tourism Agency’s portal website to apply for your license.

**Q: How do I apply for a license number for my listing? **

**Q: What is the license number? **

The license number is a 10 digit number assigned by local authorities to each individual listing you register.

** **

**Q: What if I refuse to register my listing? **

**Q: If my listing gets unlisted, how do I relist it? **

After getting a license, you will be provided a license number. Please provide that license number and any other required information to Agoda in order to relist your property on the site.


Q: I am hosting under the Hotels License, or Special Economic Zoning Act. In this case, how should I register my property on Agoda?

Or

**Q: Do I need a separate license number for each of my properties? **

Yes, you will need to obtain a license number for each listing. Please apply for your license(s) and add your license number and other necessary information to your Agoda listings.


**Q: What happens if I intentionally enter false information?**

** **

**Q: ****What will happen to my reservations if my listing is unlisted due to being unlicensed?**

Unlicensed properties in Japan may be found in violation of the Hotel Business Act, and Agoda has a policy of unlisting unlicensed properties. While bookings are not automatically canceled for unlisted properties, we reserve the right to cancel reservations for any unlicensed property. This may result in being fined according to the penalty policies outlined in your contract with Agoda. Please apply for the license as soon as possible and add the licensing number and other relevant information to your listings.


**Q: If my listing is unlisted, will Agoda automatically cancel my reservations? Should hosts cancel on their own?**

**Q: Will I still be able to access payment page if my property is unlisted?**

Yes. As long as your account is not deleted, you can still access your payment page and receive any payable funds.

# Why have I not gotten paid for a booking?

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001263287-Why-have-I-not-gotten-paid-for-a-booking

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:43:41Z

There’s a few reasons you may not have received payment yet.

You will need to complete the bank account setup for each of your properties; if you have multiple properties, you’ll need to fill in the bank settings for each one individually. To fill in your bank account information, go to Edit Listing in the Host Portal, then click on the **Payment Accounts **tab.


If your bank account status is pending, you may not have submitted the required documents to biz@agoda.com yet, or our team has not yet reviewed your property listing. If you’ve emailed the documents and still haven’t been paid after 3 to 5 days, please re-send the email with “follow-up” added to the subject line.


Ordinarily, payment is issued 24 hours after guest checkout. However, if this is the first time your property has been booked, there will be a 30-day hold until payment is processed. The 30-day payout window allows us to protect your guests and drive bookings for you. If you receive any further bookings made before the conclusion of the first 30 days payment, the same 30-day payout policy will be applied too.


Until you’ve activated the autopay feature, each payment has to be processed individually by request. To approve payments individually, follow these steps:

# How to get positive reviews from your guests?

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001647228-How-to-get-positive-reviews-from-your-guests

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:59:46Z

Good reviews can help you get more bookings. In addition to having a clean, welcoming and comfortable property, make sure you describe your home with detail and accuracy. Of course you’ll want to list all of your home’s good features, but we also recommend being as transparent as possible and not setting up false expectations. For example, you should mention if there are noisy bars or a construction site nearby. Some guests won’t mind, but all guests should get fair warning.

It’s very important to communicate with your guests. Doing so improves their experience and creates a sense of trust. We recommend staying in touch with guests before, during, and after their stay:

Remember, little details matter. You may want to leave a nice note, welcome basket, or a guide to local attractions and conveniences. If your guest is staying long-term, think of various ways to improve their stay.

Updated: 2025-06-02T08:34:12Z

Payouts for your bookings are made available within three days after the guest checks out. You can claim these by approving payable bookings on the Earnings page.

**Desktop and Agoda app**

Approved payouts will be sent to you through the method you have set up, typically taking 3-5 business days. You may also enable Auto-pay to automatically initiate payout once your conditions are met.


**What to do when amount receivable is negative**

On rare occasions, the amount receivable may be negative. This is usually due to a charge for rejecting a confirmed booking and failing to relocate the guest. You can see these charges under **Adjustments** on the **Earnings** page. In the case you see these charges and have questions, please reach out to us.


**Find the payout date for a booking**

You can see when a booking will be payable under the **Pending **tab of the **Earnings **page.

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:43:41Z

The first payment for your property (based on the first check-out date) is withheld for 30 days after guest departure in order to ensure safety and security for the guest. This 30-day payment window applies to all properties with preferred payout methods of direct deposit to bank and Paypal. This window is also applicable for any bookings and/or check-outs during that 30-day window. Once the 30-day window has passed without any dispute, all payouts will be **PROCESSED within** 24-hours of guest departure if your property is on Auto Pay, or within 1-3 days if you are manually requesting the payments. Payouts will then be sent to the bank within 3-5 business days

If you have listed multiple properties on Agoda, the 30-day payment window will apply to each of your properties. After you receive the first payout for any one property and wish to skip the 30-day payment window condition for other properties under your account, please contact us.

Once your request is approved, any payment for future bookings will be processed within 1-3 days of guest departure.

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:53:51Z

When guests cancel their bookings on Agoda, you will receive a cancellation email notification from us. Guests will be automatically refunded according to the cancellation policy you have set up for your property.

If a confirmed guest contacts you with similar requests, please let him know to reach out to us to facilitate the process. If you need to cancel or modify a confirmed reservation, please note that you can only do so by contacting us on the Agoda Hotline, indicated on the booking confirmation email. Please provide us with your Booking ID so that we can quickly address your concerns.

It is important to note that for each cancellation you initiate, you are required to compensate the amount equivalent to one night’s stay. This may also impact your Top Host status.

Please call us as well as the other booking site immediately so that we can find alternate accommodations as quickly and gracefully as possible. The customer service number is provided in the booking confirmation voucher email. Do not attempt to relocate guest(s) on your own. Keep in mind that this is a stressful situation for everyone and it’s crucial to be as kind and understanding as possible with the guests. It’s not the guests’ fault. The important thing is to resolve the situation.

To help prevent double bookings, we recommend logging into your Agoda account and any other booking services you use every day. It’s also a good idea to use our Calendar Sync feature and/or switch from Instant Book to Book on Request. If you use Channel Manager software to manage your bookings across different platforms, please check your settings. Channel Managers may at times incorrectly mark your properties as available after they have already been booked.

# Avoid getting overbooked

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023687414-Avoid-getting-overbooked

Updated: 2021-07-06T15:55:09Z

Getting overbooked is always a possibility if you are listing your property across multiple platforms. But when you cancel one booking over another, it will most certainly create an unpleasant experience for your guests. Here are some tips on how to avoid getting overbooked:

Do not panic if your property gets overbooked! Contact the guests to reconfirm their arrival details. Then analyze the bookings to determine who to relocate or cancel. The last received booking is not always the best one to change. Consider the rates, agreements, possible penalties from partners, length of stay, or any other factors associated with each booking and then take the best call.

If you choose to relocate guests who made their booking on Agoda, immediately contact the Agoda Hotline indicated on the booking confirmation email. Please provide us with your Booking ID so that we can assist you promptly.

Renting out your own place is a personal experience -- so what happens if your property or belongings are damaged by guests?

Agoda lets you set a security deposit policy that allows you to collect upfront money from guests to cover potential property damage. You have full control over the payment process, deciding when and how to collect the deposit from guests. Please note that Agoda does not handle the security deposit directly.

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:18:52Z

Top hosts meet several criteria that establish them as reliable hosts who routinely provide a high quality experience to their guests. To become a top host, you must already be a verified host, have 5 completed and departed bookings, an average review score of 7.5 or above, a response rate over 70%, and no more than two bad cancellations over a six month period. A bad cancellation occurs when a host cancels a guest’s reservation. Top hosts receive more bookings, so it’s worth making the effort to get this status.

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:16:40Z

“Bad cancellations” may affect your Top Host status. A “bad cancellation” is any cancellation made without notifying the guest. In order to preserve your Top Host status, you cannot have more than 3 bad cancellations in a 6 month period. This policy is designed to make sure guests have the best experience possible.


If the mistake is on our end, the cancellation will not count against you and will not affect your Top Host status. Contact us if you have any questions about a cancellation and please be as specific as possible about the situation. We will always do our best to make a fair decision.

Agoda is able to protect the safety and security of guests and hosts by facilitating communication through the platform while keeping phone numbers and email addresses private. We cannot provide this security for communications that occur outside of the Agoda platform. With that said, we do plan to alter our policy in the future to allow guests and hosts to exchange email and phone number once bookings are confirmed.

You can respond to reviews **but you cannot delete them**. This policy maintains transparency. Additionally, it’s instructive for you as a host to read guest reviews to identify what guests enjoy about your home as well as areas where there’s room for improvement. If you feel that the review is inaccurate, you may wish to respond, but remember to be gracious and polite.

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:56:38Z

Reviews speak volumes about your property. Our studies have shown that the number of reviews and the review score for each property have an impact on the bookings for the property. Each review is a message from the guest for you, and we encourage you to respond to them graciously. Your response to the guest reviews allows you to thank your guests for their kind words and address any grievances that the guest may have had. All of these communicate to future guests that you care.

Your responses take about 48 hours to get published on our platform.

To respond to a guest review, go to the **Listings** page, **Bookings & Earnings**, **Bookings** tab, and then click **See reviews**. You can respond in 31 different languages.


May 26, 2020: Published guest reviews and your responses will be displayed on the property page

You can customize how guests book your property under **Rates and availability >>** **Booking settings** in the Agoda extranet to fit your hosting style and ensure a smooth experience for both you and your guests. From this page, you can select your preferred booking process, set your cancellation policy, limit when guests can book, and determine the required lengths of stay.

Your property will be able to accept bookings from guests instantly once it is live on Agoda. You can change this in **Booking settings** to **Request to book** if you want to review bookings before they are confirmed. Learn more about Request to book here.

The cancellation policy you set will apply to all the bookings you receive. You can change your policy at any time by simply selecting the one you want and then clicking **Save**. Learn more about cancellation policies here.

** **

Set the maximum number of days that guests can make a reservation in advance. This gives you more control over your calendar, helps you stay flexible for personal plans or property maintenance, and lets you adjust pricing or availability as needed.

** **

Set the minimum number of days between when a guest books and their check-in date. This requirement gives you enough time to prepare your property, coordinate cleaning or maintenance, and manage your schedule.


Control how long guests can stay at your property by setting minimum and maximum length of stay requirements. You can apply these rules to all bookings or set stay date conditions for specific dates to optimize your calendar and ensure your property is booked just the way you want.

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:18:40Z

Having a clean, welcoming and comfortable home is a must, but you can give guests an extra special experience by going beyond the basics.

**First impressions are important**- think about what you can do to create a “wow” factor when guests first walk in the door. Welcome baskets, cookies, snacks or a bottle of wine can be nice surprises. Guests may have traveled a long way to get to your home, so think about any extra touches that might enhance their comfort.

If you have some information about your guests and their travel plans, you may be able to **customize gifts, treats and other amenities**. A family with children might appreciate a few toys or games, for example. If you know they are vegetarian, you could recommend good vegetarian restaurants in the area, and so on.

Occasionally, problems with guests may arise. We strongly recommend you follow these guidelines to resolve the issue:



**Stay calm!** Listen to the guest carefully and make sure you’ve heard everything. Listen rather than reacting.


**Acknowledge the problem**. Let the guest know you hear what they are saying. You don’t have to agree with the guest, but you need to consider their perspective.


**Offer a solution**. This shows that you are willing to take ownership of the problem. Keep in mind not to make promises you can’t keep.

Agoda does not provide any legal advice. Hosts are responsible for learning and complying with short term rental rules in their area, although we recommend reading the following tips:

- Research relevant city laws regarding short term rentals
- Check with your city to see if you need a license to rent your property
- Some cities, counties and states require hosts to pay taxes on rental income, so you should contact your local government.
- If you have a timeshare, lease agreement, or your home is in a condo, contact your landlord to see if renting your home is allowed.

Updated: 2024-08-28T12:05:30Z

It’s very important to keep your price up to date, where you, as the host, loaded your nightly sell rates into the calendar, and the system automatically deducts the applicable commission from those rates and this is what you get paid, unless subject to additional taxes in certain jurisdictions.

The commission you pay to Agoda is automatically deducted from the rates you input into the system. This means that the rate displayed to guests already includes the commission, ensuring transparency and simplifying the booking process.Commission rates may vary depending on property location, it’s essential to review and understand the specific commission rate applicable to your property.

In some jurisdictions, additional taxes or fees may apply to the commission you pay to Agoda. These taxes can vary significantly based on local regulations and can include value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST), or other similar levies.

An Agoda Home is the entire accommodation listed by the property owner or the property manager who has the right to manage the owner’s property. Hosts do not stay on the property with guests.

**Multi-unit** properties: These are properties that have multiple allotments or multiple room choices available for guests to book. A property owner or manager needs to register and manage these properties through our YCS system.

**Single-unit** properties: These are properties with only one allotment. Only one booking may be facilitated in a single-unit property at any given point in time. Hosts need to register and manage these properties through our Host Manage system.

# What are the differences between Agoda Homes and Hotels?

Hotels are established, professionally managed accommodations that allow paid lodging on a short-term basis. Typically, hotels have many rooms with a wide range of pricing to meet various guest requirements. In many aspects, the multi-unit Homes properties (especially the serviced apartments) function similarly to hotels.

Agoda Homes are much more personal and unique in nature. These accommodations are managed by hosts who want their guests to have a quality stay at an affordable price while offering an enjoyable local experience for guests. Agoda Homes are especially great for large groups, allowing guests to maintain their privacy and refrain from sharing common facilities with other guests.

On the Agoda platform, a hotel uses yellow star ratings. An Agoda Homes property will display an **Agoda Homes** badge and uses pink star ratings.

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:13:59Z

These details need to be added on the **Description** page.

**Property name: **Your property’s name/title is the most important. It should create the impression of a highly sought-after accommodation that meets the expectations of your potential guests.

Tips: Know your audience. Is your accommodation for business travelers, families, or romantic couples?

Examples: Spacious 4 BR Near Eiffel Tower – 7 min walk, Luxury Beach House Perfect for Romantic Weekend Getaway, Enjoy Sunsets at Fully Equipped 2BR Condo at the Beach, Rustic Private Cottage w/ King Bed + Oceanside View

**Property description: **Your property description is more than just writing about your bedrooms and bathrooms. It is about creating an exciting pitch to travelers to sell a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Today, most travelers prefer to skim through online descriptions rather than reading a lengthy block of text. To make your description easy for guests to digest, break it up into chunks with clear topic sentences or sub-headers so customers can easily follow. Overall, the description of your home should be at least 120 words.

Here is a guideline for recommended topics:

Tips: Once you have written down the description based on the information of your home, try adding further details and personal touches using these following tips:

Examples: Below is a template to help you generate a simple property description. However, we encourage you to use it as a guide and add your personal twist to make your listing stand out from the crowd.

# How to add property directions, check-in info, and house rules

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051724374-How-to-add-property-directions-check-in-info-and-house-rules

Updated: 2025-04-21T05:55:09Z

Clear and accurate information is key to creating a seamless guest experience. The Arrival guide and house rules allow you to communicate essential details about your property, helping guests plan their stay with confidence. By setting up these sections, you ensure that guests have all the information they need—from how to find your property to understanding your expectations—before and during their stay.

###

### How to add Arrival guide details

**Desktop and Agoda app**

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to Property >> Arrival guide.
- For each item (Check-in and check-out times, Check-in instructions, Directions, and Parking):
- Click Edit or Add details next to the item you wish to update.
- Make the necessary changes.
- Once done, review and click Save.

- Repeat the process for any other items you need to add or update.


###

### How to add your house rules

**Desktop and Agoda app**

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to Property >> Description.
- Scroll to Additional details and enter the rules guests must follow under House rules.
- Once done, review and click Save.


###

### How Arrival guide and house rules are used

-
**Check-in and check-out times:** Displayed on your Agoda page under Some helpful facts. This helps guests see when they can check in and check out, giving them the clarity they need to finalize their booking decisions.
-
**Check-in instructions:** These details are sent to guests a few days before their check-in date. Providing clear, step-by-step instructions ensures a smooth arrival and reduces guest anxiety about the check-in process.
-
**Directions:** Once a booking is confirmed, your directions are automatically sent to guests. This is key to helping them find your property easily, improving their first impression and ensuring they feel comfortable getting there without any confusion.
-
**Parking:** Parking information is displayed directly on your Agoda page, giving guests confidence that they’ll have a place to park upon arrival, which can be a deciding factor for those with cars.
-
**House rules:** House rules will be displayed on your Agoda page under Policies, helping guests understand your property's expectations and guidelines before booking.

##

### Tips for your Arrival guide and house rules

Setting up your Arrival guide and house rules is essential for ensuring a smooth guest experience and clear communication. Here are some practical tips to help you input these details effectively and understand their impact:

**House rules**

House rules are your opportunity to set expectations for guests during their stay. They should be simple, clear, and easy to follow. Here’s how to create effective house rules:

-
-
**Be concise and straightforward.** Avoid overly complex or specific rules that may confuse guests. Aim for 8-10 items to keep the list manageable and appealing.
-
**Focus on essentials.** Include rules about pets, smoking, quiet hours, and any fees for rule violations.
-
**Inform guests early.** While additional rules can be shared during check-in or through a guest book, it’s best to communicate key rules before booking to avoid surprises.
-
**Recommended length:** Write at least 100 words to show you care about your property and guests.


Examples of common house rules:

*Only registered guests are allowed.*
*Smoking or pets are not allowed.*
*Events or parties are not allowed.*
*Quiet time is after 11:00 PM.*
*Please dispose of all garbage in the trash can.*
*Turn off lights or AC/Heater when not in use.*
*If you break or damage something, please let us know for replacement or repair.*

**Directions to your property**

Clear directions are key to ensuring guests can easily find your property. Include the following:

-
**Transportation options:** Provide details on how guests can reach your property from nearby airports, train stations, or bus terminals. Highlight the easiest and most convenient options.
-
**Step-by-step instructions:** Include journey times, estimated costs, and instructions for entering your property (e.g., main entrance, passcode, key box).
-
**Landmarks:** Mention nearby landmarks or signs to help guests navigate.
-
**Contact information:** Provide primary and secondary contact details for assistance.
-
**Check-in outside normal hours:** Include instructions for late or early check-ins, along with any additional charges.

Example template:

The fastest way to reach our apartment is by taxi, which takes 30 minutes from [Airport Name]. Taxi fare is approximately $70.


Alternatively, you may take Bus 100 from [Airport Name] to [Bus Stop Name], which departs every hour between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Bus fare is $25, and the journey takes about 1 hour. From [Bus Stop Name], you can walk 10 minutes to our apartment, located opposite [Landmark Name].


If you have trouble finding the property, contact us at [Phone Number].

**Check-in instructions**

Providing clear check-in instructions reduces guest uncertainty and enhances their experience. Include:

- Entry details: Explain how guests can access your property (e.g., self-check-in, reception, or meeting staff).
- Key collection: Share door codes, lock-box codes, or contact details for key collection.
- Additional charges: Mention any fees for early or late check-ins to avoid surprises.

###

### Managing details across Arrival guide and Description pages

Details like check-in instructions and directions can be added to either the Arrival guide or the Description page. Changes made in one will automatically sync to the other, ensuring consistency. To streamline your setup, we recommend using the Arrival guide, as it is the most up-to-date tool for managing this information.

Updated: 2020-09-30T03:52:45Z

Agoda is Asia’s largest online travel agency that caters to more than 2 million travelers who visit our website and app every day. We are committed to providing quality stays in over 5 million properties and accommodation types ranging from hotels and resorts to apartments, homes, and villas.

While we have always had non-hotel accommodation available on our platform, the changing market demands more emphasis and focus on increasing supply and elevating quality. Agoda Homes – a core business line within Agoda – was born from this demand.

An Agoda Homes property is an entire apartment, bungalow, house, or villa listed by you: the property owner or property manager. Unlike other OTA platforms, all Agoda Homes are for the entire accommodation, which means the host does not stay on the property with their guests. The host simply facilitates check-in and check-out, provides local recommendations, and ensures a quality stay for guests.

On Agoda Homes, we support a wide range of accommodation types, including serviced apartments, homes, private villas, farm stays, chalets, boats, and many more.

You set the nightly price on the Host Manage system. This is what you get paid, unless subject to additional taxes in certain jurisdictions.

From the loaded nightly rate, we calculate a **reference sell rate** to the guest – which is the rate on which our commission is based and invoiced. This rate is displayed on the booking voucher issued by Agoda.

The reference sell rate is not necessarily the price the guest will pay. Agoda may choose to apply discounts on the reference sell rate, at our own expense, in order to get you a guest. However, this does not affect the nightly rate you load and what you get paid.

To view commission that Agoda charges on your successful bookings based on reference sell rate, go to the **Listings **page, select **Bookings & Earnings**, and then **View Commission**.

# Prepare for cleaning

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052054214-Prepare-for-cleaning

Updated: 2020-08-20T04:42:57Z

It is important to ensure you and your cleaning staff are safe and protected by taking all necessary precautions before cleaning. It is also important to know which supplies to stock up on and how to properly use them for your safety and the most effective clean. There are a few simple steps you should take to prepare for your cleaning session.

**Wait before entering your accommodation**: According to WHO, airborne respiratory droplets can last up to three hours. It’s important to note that scientific research is still unclear about how long smaller aerosol particles, such as COVID-19, can last in the air. If possible, it is highly recommended to wait 24 hours before entering your property. If you are unable to wait 24 hours, a minimum waiting time of 3 hours is advised as most airborne droplets would have settled by then.

**Air out the accommodation after entering**: Once you enter the property, open all doors and windows to increase the air circulation of your space.

**Wear personal protective equipment**: Put on proper protective equipment before entering the property and wear it throughout the cleaning session. This can reduce your risk of exposure to germs and chemicals. All cleaning staff should use the following equipment:

**Wash hands regularly**: All cleaners should wash their hands regularly throughout the cleaning process. This includes when they have the gloves on as well as when the gloves are removed. Make sure to wash hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. When handwashing is not possible, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. ** **

**Avoid touching your face while cleaning**: All cleaners should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth while cleaning.

**Use approved products**: Be sure that only approved sanitizing products are used during your cleaning session. You can refer to relevant agencies for a list of approved cleaners and disinfectants. According to WHO, products with a 70% alcohol solution or products with a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 0.1% are suitable for disinfectant products. Some commonly approved products that you may already have include:

**Read and follow instruction labels on cleaning products: **Always follow the directions on cleaning product and disinfectant labels, including how to use the product, dilution concentration, and contact time. If contact time or concentration is lower than recommended, this will hinder the effectiveness of the cleaning solution or disinfectant. However, if the chemical concentration is higher than recommended, surfaces being cleaned may be damaged.

**Check products and continuously restock:** Keep a checklist of all products needed for cleaning as well as their expiry dates. Use this checklist to determine if any items need to be restocked or replaced. Cleaning products that are past their expiration date may be less effective or ineffective at killing germs.

**Store solutions properly:** Use opaque containers to store your cleaning solutions and keep them in a covered area that is not in direct sunlight. If using chlorine solutions, prepare it daily to ensure the correct concentration is maintained.

**Do not mix cleaning solutions:** Avoid combining different product solutions as this may cause dangerous chemical reactions.

# Clean and sanitize

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052054534-Clean-and-sanitize

Updated: 2020-08-20T04:44:11Z

Cleaning is the removal of dirt, germs, and other impurities from surfaces or objects. Sanitizing is the process of killing germs on surfaces and objects using chemicals or disinfectants. The CDC recommends both cleaning and sanitizing using household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants in order to reduce any risk of spreading diseases, including COVID-19.

Here are some general cleaning instructions you should keep in mind for each room of the house.

**Order of cleaning**: Begin cleaning in the cleanest areas and progress to the dirtiest areas. In each room, start from higher to lower levels as debris may fall on the floor.

**Garbage removal:** Before cleaning in any room, remove all garbage or items left behind by the previous guests.

**Wash linens**: To prevent the spread of germs, avoid shaking dirty linens and place them directly in a laundry bag when transferring them to the washing machine. Wash all linens or textiles at the highest heat setting recommended for the fabric.

**Cleaning hard surfaces and floors:** Clean all surfaces, including shelves and hard floors. Start dusting or sweeping higher surfaces and work your way down. After dusting or sweeping, clean the surfaces with multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth. For floors, you may use a mop and floor cleaning solution. Be sure to routinely clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

**Cleaning soft surfaces**: Vacuum any soft surfaces that cannot be put in the laundry such as carpeting, rugs, or upholstery. Make sure to also vacuum soft furniture such as the sofa. Clean any stains with a brush, soap, and warm water or in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

**Sanitize all surfaces:** Keep germs at bay by wiping all surfaces with disinfectant. To be effective, sanitization usually requires the disinfectant to wet the surface for at least one minute. Be sure to read the label on your products and follow all instructions.

Common areas, such as living and dining rooms, are places where guests and family members spend most of their time with each other. Before you clean, start tidying up by removing any clutter. Follow the steps below when cleaning the common areas:

**Empty all garbage cans:** Remove all items left behind by previous guests. Reline all empty cans with new garbage bags.

**Wash and clean all linens**: Using a high heat setting, wash your linens and other textiles such as throw pillow covers, curtains, and dining room linens. Pillows, duvets, throws, and cushions that cannot be put in the laundry should be sprayed with disinfectant. To minimize the spread of dust and germs through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

**Collect and clean all objects on surfaces: **Wipe items such as lamps or decor with a microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or dust and use a multi-surface cleaner to remove any residue. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. For hard to reach places such as ceiling fans or high shelves, use an extendable duster. Start from the highest surfaces and work your way to the bottom.

**Spray or wipe high-touch areas with disinfectant**: Spray all high-touch areas such as doorknobs, blinds, keys or electronic keypads, light switches, remote controls, tabletops, and shelving with disinfectant and wipe with a microfiber cloth or wipe with disinfectant wipes and leave to dry.

**Vacuum soft surfaces**: Vacuum all soft items such as rugs and carpeted areas as well as other furniture with textile surfaces. Spot clean textiles using a water and detergent solution and a bristle brush. To clean furniture made of leather, you can use special cleaning fluid to avoid damaging the texture of the material.

**Clean the floor**: Sweep all non-carpeted areas, then mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution. Pay extra attention to corners and sides of the walls. When cleaning the floor using a vacuum or by sweeping, make sure to get areas under the sofa or large furniture. Spot clean any stains with a brush, a detergent solution, and warm water if needed.

**Clean windows and glass**: Working from the highest point to the lowest, clean all windows and glass with a glass cleaner spray and microfiber towel.

Bedrooms are resting areas for guests and one of the most important places to clean. Most items in the bedroom come in close contact with a person’s skin. These items must be in pristine condition – no signs of worn spots, tears, or stains. Follow the steps below when cleaning the bedroom:

**Empty all garbage cans:** Remove all items left behind by previous guests. Reline all empty cans with new garbage bags.

**Wash all linens**: Using a high heat setting, wash your linens and other textiles such as throw pillow covers, curtains, and dining room linens. Pillows, duvets, throws, and cushions that cannot be put in the laundry should be sprayed with disinfectant. To minimize the spread of dust and germs through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

**Clean the mattress:** Clean your mattress using a disinfectant spray. Spray the solution in a sweeping motion to cover the entire surface, then let it completely dry before using the mattress or putting on the laundered sheets.

**Collect and clean all objects on surfaces: **Wipe items such as lamps or decor with a microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or dust and use a multi-surface cleaner to remove any residue. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. For hard to reach places such as ceiling fans or high shelves, use an extendable duster. Start from the highest surfaces and work your way to the bottom.

**Wipe high-touch areas with disinfectant**: Wipe all high-touch areas with a microfiber cloth soaked in disinfectant or a disinfectant wipe. High-touch areas include doorknobs, light switches, televisions and remotes, tables, and shelf surfaces.

**Vacuum soft surfaces**: Vacuum all soft items such as rugs and carpeted areas as well as other furniture with textile surfaces such as sofas. Spot clean textiles using a water and detergent solution and a bristle brush.

**Clean the floor**: Sweep all non-carpeted areas, then mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution. Pay extra attention to corners or sides of the walls. When cleaning the floor using a vacuum or by sweeping, make sure to get areas under the bed or other large furniture.

**Clean windows and glass**: Working from the highest point to the lowest, clean all windows and glass with a glass cleaner spray and microfiber towel.

A dirty bathroom will turn guests off immediately. Bathrooms are breeding grounds for germs, so ensure to sanitize doorknobs, handles, and other hardware before you begin the cleaning process. Follow the steps below when cleaning the bathroom:

**Wash all linens: **Remove all dirty linens, towels, and shower curtains and put them in a laundry bag to prevent the spread of germs. Wash them on a high heat setting.

**Remove items from the bathroom**: Collect all portable bathroom supplies such as toiletries, soaps, and the hair dryer. Throw away all disposable items offered to guests. For non-disposable items, wipe with a multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. Finally, empty all garbage cans.

**Clean the toilet: **Spray the surface of the toilet as well as the inside of the bowl with a multi-surface cleaner. Be sure you allow for the solution to set according to the time specified on the product label. Use a toilet brush to clean inside the toilet bowl. Once clean, hold the brush over the toilet bowl and pour bleach over the brush. Let the bleach set for a couple of minutes, then pour water over the brush into the toilet bowl and flush.

**Clean all bathroom surfaces and high-touch areas:** Spray all hard surfaces such as the bathtub, shower, sink, and tiled surfaces with a multi-surface cleaner and wipe with a microfiber cloth. Use a scrub brush if needed for residue that is difficult to get off. Work from top to bottom to avoid falling debris.

**Sanitize all bathroom surfaces and high-touch areas: **After thoroughly cleaning the bathroom surfaces, spray all areas with a multi-surface disinfectant. Wipe all high-touch areas with a microfiber cloth soaked in disinfectant or a disinfectant wipe. Put the cloths used to clean the bathroom in the laundry. Do not use them in other parts of the house.

**Clean the bathroom floors**: Sweep or vacuum the bathroom floors. Once all debris has been removed, mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution.

Kitchens tend to get messy after being used. You’ll find some guests will want to cook while staying in your short-term rental and others will only make coffee in the morning. Regardless of how the space is used, it’s important to give your kitchen a deep clean after each guest departs. Follow the steps below on cleaning your kitchen area:

**Empty all garbage cans: **Remove all items, food, and garbage the previous guests left in the kitchen.

**Wash all kitchen utensils:** All dishes, silverware, and glassware should be washed in the dishwasher, including items that appear clean. These items may have been touched or not thoroughly cleaned by previous guests. If you do not have a dishwasher or if there are items that need to be washed by hand, use soap and hot water. Remember to also wash the microwave plate and oven racks or trays.

**Clean kitchen shelves and wall storage**: Clean the shelves you use to hold your dishes with multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth, then spray with a multi-surface disinfectant and allow to air dry. Only return dishes and utensils back to the shelves once it has air dried.

**Clean kitchen equipment**: Spray oven cleaner on kitchen appliances as well as the stovetop, oven interior, and microwave interior. Leave the spray to set following the time indicated on the label, and wipe with a microfiber cloth or rough sponge and water to remove any buildup. Use water to help loosen any tough buildup.

**Clean remaining kitchen surfaces and high-touch areas:** Clean the remaining surfaces of the kitchen with the multi-surface cleaner and microfiber cloth, and spray with multi-surface disinfectant and allow to air dry. This includes counter-tops, drawer handles, the refrigerator exterior and interior, the microwave exterior, and the pantry. Any remaining kitchen appliances such as toasters should be cleaned in the same way. Remember to unplug the kitchen appliances before spaying any cleaning or disinfectant solutions on them.

# Wrap up the cleaning session

Updated: 2020-08-20T03:06:30Z

Once your property has been properly cleaned and sanitized, you’ll be ready to throw out and store your cleaning supplies. Follow these instructions to wrap up your cleaning session in a way that avoids cross contamination:

**Wash your hands**: All cleaners should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water as soon as they remove their gloves. If this is not possible, use a hand sanitizing solution with 60% alcohol content. Remember to do this before going about your normal daily routine.

**Safely dispose of non-reusable cleaning supplies or personal protective equipment: **Throw away disposable products such as disinfectant wipes or sponges.

**Clean and sanitize any reusable cleaning supplies: **Avoid cross-contamination by emptying and sanitizing the vacuum and sanitizing tools such as brooms or mops between each property or cleaning session. Wash any cleaning cloths at the highest heat setting appropriate for the material.

**Clean and sanitize reusable personal protective equipment**: Wash any goggles or face shields with soap and warm water and spray with disinfectant spray. Reusable face masks should be washed at the highest heat setting appropriate for the material.

**Check and restock cleaning supplies as needed**: Check the stock and expiry dates of your cleaning supplies and replace anything as needed. Have a list of all supplies that are used so it is easy for you to keep inventory and refill when needed. This list should also include any supplies you leave for guests during their stay.

# Create your host profile

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052543334-Create-your-host-profile

Updated: 2024-08-28T12:45:06Z

No matter how attractive your property is or how complete the amenities are, it all comes down to the credibility of your home. Giving your listing an identity helps to build trust and credibility, increasing the likelihood of getting bookings.

**Host photo:** Guests looking to stay at a property feel more comfortable communicating with a host they can see. Here are some tips for choosing the ideal host profile photo:

Did you know? A study on host-accommodation platforms found that when a host is perceived to be trustworthy, the better the listing will be and higher the probability of the listing being booked.

**Host name:** Provide your First and Last name, and then the Display name. First and Last name is used for Agoda’s internal purposes only and will not be visible to customers. Display name is visible on the property’s page. You can either put your nickname or your initials here. We recommend you put your first name or nickname and your last name initial as your Display name.

**Preferred language:** Flaunt your language skills to get more bookings. This may be a selling point for overseas guests who are looking for hosts that can speak their native language.

**Host location:** Tell your guests which country, state, and city you live in so that they are aware which time zone you are in. Don’t worry, your exact location will be used internally and will not be publicly displayed on your listing.

**Host description:** Now this is an opportunity to make a good impression with your potential guests by letting them know you more on a personal level. Greet them, tell them who you are, where you are from, or what are your interests. The key is to be relatable. Guests are more likely to book from a host that they can identify or connect with.

Here are some topics you can write about to describe yourself:

Did you know? A study on host-accommodation platforms found that travelers demonstrated higher trust and intention to book listings from hosts whose bio conveys them as being well-traveled.

Note: Host photo, display name, location, and description will be displayed on the property’s page. We currently support only English characters and your property’s local language for free-text fields.

Sign in to www.agoda.com/homes with your newly created password and go to the **Profile** tab. All fields related to your host profile are included within this page.

To update your host profile information later, you may always come back to the **Profile** page.

# Listing your property: Setting the nightly price

Updated: 2025-05-14T07:53:34Z

The price you set is the amount you’ll be paid, except in certain jurisdictions where additional taxes may apply. To determine a competitive price, research similar properties in your area. Consider factors like maximum occupancy, number of rooms, features, and nearby attractions.

Setting a fair and appealing price will help attract guests. When listing your property, consider pricing slightly below the local average to draw more interest. Don’t worry about starting low—you can always adjust your price later.


When listing your property on Agoda, you set the nightly rate on the **Pricing **step. This will be the price for the **Max guests allowed** you set on the **Basics** step. If you want to set rates for extra guests, you can adjust the occupancy and set the extra guest rate once your property is listed.

**Set the price yourself**


**Manage your nightly price with a channel manager**


You can manage your nightly price whenever you need on the Agoda extranet using the Pricing page or Calendar.

# Provide safety for guests during their stay

Accommodation providers are always having to adapt to changes in the travel industry, and so too are guests. Putting measures in place to enhance your cleaning and ensuring safe interactions with guests will go a long way towards giving them the comfort and peace of mind they need to book a stay at your property. Here are some things you can do to accommodate guests so that they feel safe and secure:

**Contactless check-in and check-out:** Offer contactless check-in and check-out such as a key lockbox or electronic lock to better ensure social distancing. If you have contactless check-in and check-out or plan to offer it at your accommodation, make sure to update your property information and check-in details so guests are informed of the safe environment you are creating.

**Social distancing**: Practice physical distancing if face-to-face interaction with guests is necessary. Instead of a handshake, opt for forms of greetings that do not involve physical contact. Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter when interacting with guests and absolutely avoid any interactions if you are showing any symptoms of sickness.

**Provide cleaning supplies for your guests**: Empower your guests by setting out cleaning supplies they can use. Guests feel more comfortable if they can clean on their own during their stay. Some key items to stock up on are disposable paper towels, multi-surface cleaner, and disinfectant wipes or sprays.

**Provide a reminder about your cleanliness efforts: **Reassure guests by placing a reminder in your welcome booklet or on a desk in the common area informing guests of the following: *This property has been properly cleaned and sanitized for your arrival.*

**Provide protective equipment and supplies for guests**: Providing protective equipment for guests show you care about their personal safety. Small gestures such as leaving antibacterial hand sanitizer, reusable face masks, disposable gloves, and extra hand soap could go a long way.

**Remove shoes when entering the house**: Asks guests to remove their shoes when stepping into indoor areas of the accommodation to avoid dirt and germs from entering the house from outside.

**Educate guests on safe practices**: Inform guests how they can contribute to preventing the spread of germs and what actions they should take if they identify symptoms based on WHO guidelines. Provide a list of local emergency numbers and other important contact information.

**Tips on tidying up bedrooms:**

-
Before you start shooting, make sure the clutter from the main bedroom is cleared. Cleaner scenes are less distracting to travelers and will make your space more welcoming.
-
Leave out unsightly objects. Make sure windows, mirrors and floors are spotless.
-
Turn off the television and hide any wires or cables.
-
Leave in the room only what’s available when guests arrive – for example, do not add items like flower arrangements, assortment of magazines, or items that is won’t be offered to guests.
-
Set the ambiance to reflect the energy of your place but don’t overdo it or the space would look unnatural.


**Tips on tidying up bathrooms:**

-
It is important to have clean bathrooms. These details matter and should not be underestimated.
-
Toilet seats must be closed.
-
A full roll of toilet paper makes it seem like it was recently cleaned.
-
Make sure sinks, showers and baths are not wet. Open shower curtains, if it is not glass, so travelers can get the full picture.
-
Towels that are hanging or folded should be of equal lengths.
-
Trash bins must be empty.



**Things to avoid: **

- Road signs or parked cars.
-
Identifying information such as house numbers.
-
People or animals.
-
Any corporate logos, especially hotels.
-
Unsightly objects or views such as construction sites nearby.
-
Poorly lit places.
-
Identical images taken at a different angle.
-
Images of area landmarks or views that you cannot see from the property.

Guests who choose to stay in Homes properties instead of hotels do so because Homes are cozy, personal, and unique in nature. Treat your guests well. A happy guest will leave you a good review and help you get more bookings in the future. Good reviews are an important decision-making factor for travelers. Here are some tips and tricks that will make your guests’ stay pleasant:

-
Communicate with your guests to inspire trust. We recommend that you reach out to your guests proactively once the booking has been confirmed and continue to stay in touch throughout their stay.
-
Provide clear check-in instructions to your guests. Travelers do not like uncertainty. Leave them detailed instructions on how to get into your property once they arrive.
-
Cleanliness is important. Keep your property sparkling clean. Tidy up the furniture, prepare the bathroom, clean and sanitize the floor and other surfaces. Your guests will appreciate that extra effort you put in to clean your property.
-
Add that personal touch. Some welcome goodies like a welcome basket of snacks could cheer up your guests after a long day on the road. If you are aware of your guests’ plans or itinerary, you may be able to put together some local recommendations for them.

# Why and how to use Request to book

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055227013-Why-and-how-to-use-Request-to-book

Updated: 2025-06-30T05:13:20Z

As a host, you have the flexibility to decide how guests book your property. While allowing guests to book instantly is highly recommended for maximizing bookings, some hosts may prefer additional time to review booking requests before confirming a stay. **Request to book** provides this flexibility, giving you the opportunity to ensure each booking aligns with your preferences and property needs.


**Why choose Request to book?**

**Request to book** allows you to manually review and respond to each booking request within 24 hours. This option can be helpful if:

- You need time to review booking details, such as the length of stay or group size.
- You want to ensure your property is a good fit for the guest’s needs.
- Your property has specific rules or requirements that may need clarification before confirming a booking.

This approach offers more time to manage bookings thoughtfully, but it’s worth noting that it may result in fewer bookings, as some guests prefer the convenience of instant confirmation.


**How to switch to Request to book**

**Desktop**

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from
**Listings**.
- Navigate to
**Rates and availability** **>>Booking settings**.
- Change how guests can book your property to
**Request to book**.
- Confirm the change, then click
**Save**.

**Agoda app**

- Open the Agoda app, switch to host mode, and navigate to your listing.
- Tap
**More **>> **Rates and availability** >> **Booking settings**.
- Change how guests can book your property to
**Request to book**.
- Confirm the change and then click
**Save**.


**Things to keep in mind**

-
**Request to book** gives you the time and flexibility to thoughtfully review each booking request. However, it may also reduce your property’s visibility and booking potential, as many guests prefer instant confirmation.
- If you choose
**Request to book**, clearly outline your property’s rules or requirements in your listing’s description to help guests understand what to expect before submitting a request.
- Install the Agoda app and turn on notifications to stay aware of reservation requests. Remember, these requests are automatically declined 24 hours after they are received.
- Always respond to reservation requests promptly. If you can’t accept a request, decline it quickly and consider including a polite message to the guest explaining why. This ensures a smooth experience and keeps the door open for future bookings.

All hosts and properties partnering with Agoda are required to complete host details and property ownership information, starting October 01, 2020, regardless of the property’s registration date on Agoda. This is to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements and avoid any service interruptions.

If your property is registered as a single-unit home property, you are required to complete:

**Host details information**: Please identify yourself as hosting properties on your own behalf or managing properties on behalf of property owners.

If you are an existing host on Agoda, you will need to provide the above host details information when adding a new listing to your account or when updating any host profile information as indication here.

**Property ownership Information**: For any individual who owns 20% or more of the property, please provide details on the ultimate beneficial owners. The details required are first and last names, country of residence, nationality and date of birth. Please provide the property legal name (in case there is no legal name, please provide the property name as registered on Agoda), address and zip code. If any portion of the property is under government ownership or control, please provide the official’s details as well. **This requirement is mandatory for every property that is registered on Agoda.**

Depending on the country your property is in, the property ownership information will need to be completed within 30, 60 or 90 days of the property going live on Agoda.

If your property is registered as a multi-unit property, you are required to complete property ownership information only.

Updated: 2024-08-28T11:20:33Z

You will be amazed at how much impact photos have on travelers when it comes to choosing where to stay. The right photos to represent your home can quickly maximize your likelihood of getting bookings. Based on past trends, properties with at least 10 photos can make up to 9x more bookings than properties with fewer photos. We recommend a minimum of 10 photos to give travelers a clear idea of your offerings. These should include:

-
**Common areas:** At least one photo of the exterior, the entrance, and the surrounding environment as well as a photo for each key amenity.


**Rooms**: At least one photo of each bedroom, each bathroom, and each key room amenity.


-
**Main photo: **Pick a main photo that will leave a lasting impression. Remember, this is the big photo that travelers see on the search results page and will invite them directly to your home listing. Selecting the image that best displays your home’s unique selling point will help draw more attention from your potential guests. Here are suggested ideas for picking a main photo based on other successful listings:

-
Exterior shot of the outside of your home.
-
Interior or outdoor shot highlighting an important amenity such as a spacious living room or pool.
- Bedroom with the bed as the main focal point.



Please ensure the following criteria are met for your property photos:

-
Minimum resolution of 800 x 600 pixels (recommend 2048 x 1536 pixels)
- 4:3 aspect ratio.
-
Landscape orientation.
-
JPEG format.

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055284053-Tips-for-shooting-property-images-equipment-and-camera-tricks

Updated: 2024-08-28T12:05:34Z

You don’t have to spend big to take photos of your property. Using anything from a mobile phone to a professional grade camera, you can capture each room and amenity and appeal to guests. Here are some basics to get you started.


**Photography tricks:**

-
**Rule of thirds**: Turn on your camera’s grid feature or visually divide your image into thirds (imagine a 3x3 square grid over your screen). Use these lines as guides to place your most important objects along the intersections for optimal composition, allowing you to snap a more eye-catching photo.

-
**Leading lines**: Our eyes are naturally drawn to vertical, parallel, diagonal, and even strong horizontal lines. Photos with these kind of lines as the main subject will make viewers feel like they are in the place that is pictured.



-
**Wide shots**: Hold steady and take a wide shot view at eye-level to help travelers visualize the whole space. Make sure that the horizontal and vertical lines in the photos are straight. If you have one available, use a tripod to help you with this.


**Lighting**: Natural light is your best friend. Take photos during the day and open the curtains to let in natural light. Avoid taking photos on a gloomy or cloudy day as the photos will turn out dull. If there isn’t enough natural light in the room, brighten up the space by simply turning on the lights.


-
**No filters or special lenses**: Don’t take black-and-white or fish-eye photos. Show travelers what the room really looks like without distorting the images. This will make the images appear more credible and guests will be more willing to book.


**Mood and tone**: Adjusting the white balance can change the lighting tone of your image. You want to keep the tone clean, bright, and as natural as possible. The best photo temperature is pure white with consistent white balance. This can be adjusted under your camera’s settings.


-
**Editing**: Avoid using HDR, sharpening, shadows, highlights, and clarity filters as much as possible. These will give an inaccurate and unnatural interpretation of the space.

# More tips on how to best photograph your Home – timing and areas to shoot

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055284133-More-tips-on-how-to-best-photograph-your-Home-timing-and-areas-to-shoot

Updated: 2024-08-28T11:22:19Z

**For common areas**, the “golden hour” is the perfect time to shoot your exterior shots. Take advantage of the time just after sunrise or just before sunset. When the sun is at this low angle and not directly above, photos will have a magical quality of light, with shadows and contrasts that make their centerpiece pop.


The property’s entrance is not to be missed. Travelers need to know exactly what the property looks like when they arrive, so taking shot of the entrance as well as the building’s façade in the context of the street is crucial to a smooth check-in experience.


Capture the surrounding area. If your property has beautiful natural surroundings, show the surroundings in wide property shots so that travelers can sense the specialness of staying there. If you have a city location, choose a property shot angle that includes surrounding architecture or items with cultural interest, such as statues, bridges, old buildings, or markets. Be careful not to capture the house number, road/street signs or parked cars.


Show off your space and community areas. Take photos of each community area from various angles to showcase the entire space. Today’s travelers love to take photos and selfies on vacation, so think like an Instagram influencer. Offer travelers backdrops to their coolest vacation photos, and you will get more bookings.


Highlight all your amenities. Think about what travelers will enjoy when staying at your property. Well-equipped kitchens should be highlighted, including specific equipment, like gourmet coffee machines or a nice cooking range. Also, do not forget to show photos of the balcony, pool, gym, garden, or even the fireplace. Be sure to capture any unique features and amenities that can help a traveler choose your property over a similar one. Sometimes something as simple as an oven, or a rain shower head, can be the deciding factor!


Showcase accessibility features. Guests using wheelchairs, canes, walkers, or other mobility facilities should be able to visualize themselves navigating through the property. Wide walkways, or accessible feature such as a roll in shower should not be overlooked – these can help you appeal to travelers with special needs.

Highlight unique details that can bring your place to life! Whether it is a piece of artwork, a funny paining or a vintage vase from a local market, capture them in your photos to give some personality to your place. These unique visuals will set you apart from other properties. Remember, travelers who rent homes are skipping the hotels for a reason. They seek something special, local, and memorable.


Ambience. Maximize the hominess and warmth as much as possible and place emphasis on the overall ambiance of your space. Show travelers how special your property is by highlighting its unique vibe. For example, if a sense of local culture is reflected in the design of your property or the furniture, show it off in the photos.


**For bedroom shots**, let in as much natural light as possible for indoor shots. Keep blinds and curtains open to show view and enhance the entire space and keep lights on to help further brighten up the room. Capturing a little of the view out the window can help a traveler imagine your place in the context of its surroundings.


Aim at a corner of the room to add a touch of dimensionality to the photo. Shooting directly onto a wall makes a space look smaller than what it is in real life, while shooting into a corner can highlight the broadness and depth of the space.


For smaller spaces, take shots from different angles. You could even take them from outside the bathroom door or inside the shower. Experiment with what works best for your property.

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:12:14Z

All hosts in Japan require a license in order to rent out their properties. For properties in Japan to be live on Agoda, we need the property’s license number - a 10-digit number assigned by local authorities to each individual property you wish to rent out. To apply, visit Japan Tourism Agency’s portal website.

Any unlicensed property in Japan has been deactivated since June 15, 2018. A deactivated property does not mean a deleted account. As long as your account is still active on Agoda, you may access your profile to manage your payments and settings.

Any booking for un-licensed properties in Japan with a check-in date on or after June 15, 2018 must be canceled to comply with the country’s regulations. To stay up to date on any rules and regulations, we recommend you visit the Japan Tourism Agency’s website.

If your property has been impacted, you will not be able to receive any bookings. If you wish to reactivate your property, contact us and provide your license number.

Note: Do not intentionally enter false information. Doing so may lead to penalties from national and local regulations. License information provided by you will be displayed on your property page on Agoda and will be subject to inspection by the regulators. Agoda reserves the right to deactivate any property that is found to have missing or false license information.

You may also add the license number yourself on Host Manage. Go to the **Listings **page. Click **Edit listing** and select **Rental License** under **Legal**. Provide your license type, number, full legal name, email address, property address, and room number. Save your changes.


September 14, 2020

Note: You may add rental license information only on Host Manage web. This functionality is not available on the app.

Pricing is the most important factor for guests when they are looking for accommodation. In addition to setting a competitive nightly price for your property, we encourage you to utilize our wide range of promotional discounts to make your property more attractive. Unlike channel discounts which are user-specific, promotional discounts are available to all potential guests.

To set up attractive promotions, you may select any of the available templates below or apply a custom promotion.

**Early Bird/Adv****ance**** Purchase**: This helps secure bookings early, typically 30-90 days before guest arrival.

**Last Minute****:** Run some last-minute promotions to appeal to late bookers or to attract a booking when a guest cancels at the last minute. With this promotion, guests get a discount if they book within a few days (typically 7) of arrival.

**72-****H****our**** Promotion**: This limited time offer is best utilized when you want to secure bookings within a short period of time. This promotion creates a sense of urgency for the guest towards a property that may be in high demand.

**Weekend Getaway****:** This promotion allows you to encourage full weekend bookings, perfect for guests looking for weekend getaways.

**First 3 Guests Promotion: **This promotion allows your first three guests to receive a steep 33% discount on your newly registered property. Such a discount increases the possibility of your property getting booked quickly. With the first few bookings, your property will start ranking higher on our search page. Also, a good guest experience during these stays will increase your chances of receiving great reviews, meaning a higher possibility of subsequent bookings.

**Long Stays**: We encourage you to provide steep discounts for long stays as a long booking can often be more lucrative than multiple short bookings.

**After****-****Hours Promotion****:** By default, this promotion may be used between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM (property’s local time), but it may be adjusted if you require.

**Express Tonight**: This promotion allows for immediate bookings, and you may choose to have the guest stay the same night, next day or day after.

**China Only**: This promotion is available for guests who browse Agoda in Mandarin or search from Greater China origins.

**Free Night**: This is a catchy promotion for guests looking for freebies.

Unable to find something that fits your requirements? Use the **Customized Promotion** template to create your own. This basic template allows you to select range of booking dates, stay dates, and a discount that can be either a percentage, fixed amount, or free nights.

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055450233-Information-on-Universal-Payment-Cards-UPC

Updated: 2024-08-28T12:43:46Z

The Universal Payment Cards (UPC) payout method is available only for properties with a credit card machine that allows them to charge the virtual credit card number without a physical card. If you wish to set up UPC as your property’s preferred payout method, please contact us.

Note: For security reasons, the UPC number is not visible on the booking voucher. It can only be found on Host Manage. For non-refundable bookings, the charge can be made on the booking date. For all other bookings, the charge can be made only after guest check-out. Do not charge or pre-authorize these cards before the guest check-out as the card will be declined and will become void. Please charge only the amount that is reflected on the booking details; charging any other amount (such as parking fees or other fees) will make the transaction void. UPC payments may be processed up to 150 days after check-out.

You may find UPC details for each booking and process your payouts through the web. Go to the **Listings** page and click **Payment accounts**. Click **GET PAID**.

August 7, 2020

Each booking has its unique UPC details. When you are ready to process your payout, search for the booking by using the **Booking ID** or by providing other key details.

Expand the booking information by clicking on the booking and view UPC details. Process the payment using your credit card machine.

# Thailand VAT

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403266014739-Thailand-VAT

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:14:02Z

In order to comply with the law in a timely manner, we will commence with the process of registering under the VAT Act and apply 7% VAT to Thai consumers (not VAT registered) bookings made on or after 1 September 2021.

We will rely on the VAT information in our system which was provided by you and that such information is complete, accurate, and correct to the best of your knowledge as of the date you provided it.

The Act Amending the Revenue Code No. 53 B.E. 2564 (2021) (“e-Service Tax Law”) regarding value added tax (“VAT”) collection by foreign electronic service providers who provide services to non-VAT registrants in Thailand was published in the Royal Gazette on 10 February 2021, to take effect as of 1 September 2021.

As a company registered in Singapore providing electronic service to Thai consumers, Agoda is required to register under the e-Service Tax Law. Under the Act, Agoda is required to remit 7% VAT on amounts earned from Thai consumers to the Thai Revenue Department.

“Thai consumer” refers to a “service recipient who is non-VAT registered in Thailand”.

Under the VAT Act:

To update your VAT ID on the web after the property is live, go to the **Listings **page and click on **Edit listing****.** Then select **Tax. **Provide the 13-digit VAT ID and click **Save**.


June 11, 2021

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:10:22Z

The e-Card is a physical credit card that Agoda provides to you for charging all eligible bookings. Like any other credit card, the Agoda e-Card can be swiped at any POS terminal as long as the terminal is under the 7011 merchant category code (MCC for Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, or Central Reservation Services businesses).

Once you receive your e-Card from us, along with instructions on how to use it, please confirm receipt by **Contacting Us**. The e-Card has no value in it until booking transactions are made. Your e-Card will also have an expiry date, so please make sure to check and only submit payment before its expiry.

Payments will be available to process up to 150 days after check-out. However, we recommend processing payments as soon as possible. Please also ensure that charges are processed in the same currency as the booking in order to avoid undercharging or overcharging.

Please **Contact Us** if you wish to set up the e-Card as your property’s preferred payout method.

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403600372115-What-should-I-do-if-I-can-t-accommodate-a-guest

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:43:46Z

Agoda is committed to providing the best travel experience to our guest and guarantees that they will be able to stay at the property they booked. Therefore, when you are unable to honor our booking, it not only harms our reputation, but it also creates a bad guest experience.

Under an unusual circumstance where you are unable to honor our booking and accommodate the guest at your property, this is considered booking rejection as stated in Agoda’s Terms and Conditions . You will be responsible to provide and prepay suitable alternate accommodation for our guest, including a private transfer at no extra cost. We recommend contacting your guest in advance to inform them of these arrangements via our Messaging System.

In the event that no alternative is available, you may contact** the Agoda Hotline for assistance **and,** based on ****Agoda’s Terms and Conditions section 14.4**, for each Booking that you fail to honor, you shall compensate Agoda an amount equivalent to one night's average nightly value of the Booking if you accommodate the Guest at your property or two nights' average nightly value if you relocate the Guest. This cost will be charged to your property later, depending on the payment method used by your property. This will normally be reflected as ‘**Adjusted Transaction**’ under your Transaction Page.

You can reach the Agoda Hotline team through the Contact us button and select **Booking related** and **Cannot honor Agoda booking**. If you have urgent booking-related issues, call us at the Agoda Hotel Hotline in your country as soon as possible.


*June 11, 2021*


In order to prevent future booking rejections, we recommend the following approach:

Cause |
Recommendation |
|
This occurs when multiple reservations are made for the same room on the same night |
Set up two-ways Calendar Sync to manage your availability across different platforms |
Incorrect price |
Familiarize yourself with the setup of your Calendar Rates, Promotions, Channel Discounts, and Additional FeesLearn how you can Calculate Your Net Rate with following guideline:(Amount loaded in Calendar) – (Promotion applied during that selling period + Channel discount applied) + (Additional fee if applied)After setting your nightly rate in the calendar, always double check the rates on Agoda.com |
|
|
Bank setup is rejected. Bank setup is pending. The 30-day payout window has not passed yet Autopay hasn’t been activated yet. Manually approve the payout and learn how to set up auto-pay |
|
|
Set up check-in instruction to remind guests to contact you at least 1 day in advance prior to check-in |
|
Property is unavailable |
Please make sure to plan ahead and close your availability according to your renovation timeline, or at least 30 days before deactivation. |
|
|
Close out your calendar allotment and availability to avoid receiving future bookings. Check if you have any upcoming bookings. If yes, please reach out to guests to inform them of the latest regulations and follow the above process. |

When your property receives a booking, you will receive an email confirmation from us. In case you miss the email notification, you may check your upcoming bookings in host manage.

Here is a checklist for you to ensure that a booking is confirmed before allowing guests to check-in:

Any bookings made through Agoda will be reviewed and verified to prevent any fraudulent activity.

Be sure to verify the identity of each person who checks in for a stay, ensuring that the person is the correct guest or another authorized person named in the booking.

You are advised to secure a room deposit from guests upon check-in, which must be refundable upon check-out, to insure against property damage. You may **add a property policy **in house rule section and communicate with customers about this policy before check-in.

Agoda will not be able to collect security deposits on your behalf and will not be responsible for any damage done to your property during any guests' stay.

Note: If you do not receive booking confirmation from Agoda or find that the booking status is canceled, please reach out to the Agoda Customer Service team to check on the booking status.

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:20:28Z

The NSW Government’s * **Code of conduct for the short-term rental accommodation industry* of October 2021 (the “Code”) states the following: * *

*2.2.5 On and from the day that registration on the premises register becomes mandatory under planning laws, a booking platform must ensure that short-term rental accommodation premises are not advertised on the booking platform’s online booking service unless: (a) the premises is registered on the premises register, and (b) the registration number for the premises is displayed alongside the details of the premises on the booking platform’s online booking service*


All STRA premises in NSW require now a license in order to rent out their properties. For properties in NSW to be live on Agoda, we need the property’s license number assigned by local authorities to each individual property you wish to rent out. To apply, visit Short Term Rental Accommodation (STRA) | Planning Portal - Department of Planning and Environment (nsw.gov.au)


Any unlicensed property in NSW will be deactivated from November 1st, 2021. A deactivated property does not mean a deleted account. As long as your account is still active on Agoda, you may access your profile to manage your payments and settings.

Any booking for un-licensed properties in NSW with a check-in date on or after November 1st, 2021 must be canceled to comply with the NSW’s regulations. To stay up to date on any rules and regulations, we recommend you visit the Short-term rental accommodation - (nsw.gov.au).


If your property has been impacted, you will not be able to receive any bookings. If you wish to reactivate your property, Contact Us and provide your license number.

Note: Do not intentionally enter false information. Doing so may lead to penalties from the NSW government. License information provided by you will be displayed on your property page on Agoda and will be subject to inspection by the NSW government. Agoda reserves the right to deactivate any property that is found to have missing or false license information.

You may request re-activation of your property by us at AgodaHomes-Australia@agoda.com.


Update on Web

You may also add the license number yourself on Host Manage. Go to the **Listings **page. Click **Edit listing** and select **Rental License** under **Legal**. Provide your license type, number, full legal name, email address, property address, and room number. Save your changes.




Update on App

Note: You may add rental license information only on Host Manage web. This functionality is not available on the app.



**FAQ**

The NSW Government has implemented a new statewide regulatory framework for Short-Term Rental Accommodations (STRA) to complement the mandatory Code of Conduct. This new STRA regulation requires a license in order to rent out your propriety on Agoda.

Below are answers to frequently asked questions, but we also highly recommend that you visit the Short-term rental accommodation - (nsw.gov.au) website to apply for your license.


**Q: How do I apply for a license number for my listing?**

**Q: What is the license number? **

The license number is a digit number assigned by The department of Planning, Industry and Environment to each individual listing you register.


**Q: What if I refuse to register my listing?**


**Q: If my listing gets unlisted, how do I relist it?**

After getting a license, you will be provided a license number. Please provide that license number and any other required information to Agoda in order to relist your property on the site.


**Q: Do I need a separate license number for each of my properties?**

Yes, you will need to obtain a license number for each listing. Please apply for your license(s) and add your license number and other necessary information to your Agoda listings.


**Q: What happens if I intentionally enter false information?**


**Q: What will happen to my reservations if my listing is unlisted due to being unlicensed? **

Unlicensed STRA properties in NSW may be found in violation of the code of conduct, and Agoda has a policy of unlisting unlicensed properties. While bookings are not automatically canceled for unlisted properties, we reserve the right to cancel reservations for any unlicensed property. This may result in being fined according to the penalty policies outlined in your contract with Agoda. Please apply for the license as soon as possible and add the licensing number and other relevant information to your listings.


**Q: If my listing is unlisted, will Agoda automatically cancel my reservations? Should hosts cancel on their own?**

# French Meuble de Tourisme license regulation

Source: https://agodahomeshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5870701117331-French-Meuble-de-Tourisme-license-regulation

Updated: 2022-12-15T10:20:28Z

The French Government implemented a new statewide regulatory framework for furnished tourist accommodations, “Meublés de Tourisme” in France (Code of Conduct). As you may know, this regulation requires Agoda to retain a host name, host address and residence category (Main/Second) for each property listed on our site.

While the “Meublés de Tourisme” planning rules may apply already in your city, you still need to update your license number in Agoda's system in order to keep your property listing active.

Please be sure to update your license number and other required information as soon as possible.

Bookings made for your property without updated license information will be cancelled, and the property will be deactivated on Agoda.

Update on Web

You may also add the license number yourself on Host Manage. Go to the **Listings **page. Click **Edit listing** and select **Rental License** under **Legal**. Provide your license type, number, full legal name, email address, property address, and room number. Save your changes.


If you would like Agoda to enter your license number(s) on your behalf, please contact us here.

For more information about these requirements, please visit our local partner: TOURIZ.FR - FAQ.


Update on App

Note: You may add rental license information only on Host Manage web. This functionality is not available on the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

La législation française a mis en place un nouveau cadre réglementaire commune par commune pour les hébergements touristiques meublés dit « Meublés de Tourisme » en France (Loi pour une République numérique et la Loi ELAN). Vous savez peut-être déjà que ce règlement oblige Agoda à qualifier la catégorie de votre résidence (principale ou secondaire) pour chacune de nos annonces sur notre site et à figurer votre numéro d’enregistrement.

Si votre commune a déjà mis en place les règles pour les « Meublés de Tourisme », vous devez mettre à jour votre numéro d’enregistrement dès que possible dans le système d'Agoda afin de maintenir votre annonce sur notre site.

Sans la mise à jour de ces informations, les réservations qui sont confirmées seront annulées et votre logement sera désactivé sur Agoda.


Update on Web

Pour rajouter votre numéro d’enregistrement sur le site d’Agoda Homes, allez sur “Modifier le listing” puis cliquez sur “Licence de location”. Remplissez votre numéro d’enregistrement en dessous de “Numéro de licence”. Ajoutez aussi votre nom complet, votre e-mail, puis sauver en cliquant sur “Enregister”

# How do I change my property description?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006667768-How-do-I-change-my-property-description

Updated: 2021-10-01T23:22:00Z

**Overview**
**In this article, you will find information about property descriptions on Agoda.**
**Content **
This article includes
|


**What is ****a p****roperty ****d****escription****?**

A property description covers the main information and selling points of your property. After reading it, a traveler should have a brief understanding of your property, such as the location, room types, facilities, and other features. A complete and well-written description will set your property apart and attract more bookings.




**How do I change my property description?**

Property descriptions on Agoda.com are automatically generated by an algorithm using the data you have provided. There is also an option to add your own description as well, you can send your hotel description in English or in local language(s) to Accommodation Support Team by clicking 'Need Help' button in YCS.

**Property Description Requirements**


There are certain rules we need to follow:

- Word count cannot exceed 160 words.
- The content must be unique, meaning it must not be a duplicate of other websites (copyright)
- Descriptions must be in paragraph format. No other format will be accepted (i.e. bullet point, screenshots, links to websites, etc.)
- The content must be written in the third person perspective (never use “we”, “us”, “I” or “our”)
- Recommended content includes the property’s location, facilities, the hotel’s outstanding features, and other unique selling points.
- Content must not include directions to the property, public notes, policies, or excessive information about facilities, restaurants, special offerings, schedules, etc.
- The content should be clear and easy to understand -- no flowery phrases, redundant information, overuse of adjectives, or excessive listings.
- Do not mention competitors or other hotels.
- The Content Team will try its best to include all information as requested, as long as it is necessary, useful for the guests, and conforms to our guidelines. The descriptions that our team adds is considered final.


**What is the best way to write a property description?**

Each paragraph should include a category summary. Many users only read the first sentence, so it should contain the most important information. The description should end with a context summary that helps a traveler visualize that property as an integral part of the vacation or business travel he or she is booking.


**Category summary**

Most travelers think about their accommodation in broad, standardized categories, and it’s therefore important to immediately inform the user of what kind of category the property fits in.

-
**Traveler purpose: **Transit hotel, business and convention hotel, road motel, beach resort, etc. These categories allow user to immediately identify or un-identify with the property.
-
**Property infrastructure or building type: L**arge resort or small BnB, modern or historic, high-rise or hidden alley, the building itself tells a big part of the story.
-
**Location: **Near the airport, in the gothic quarter, atop a mountain, next to the golf course, these aspects help the user evaluate the property in relation to their anticipated itinerary.

-
**Price: **Supremely indulgent, luxury, mid-price, high-value, budget – sure, the user can see the actual prices on the page, but they also want to compare those prices to their own preconceived notions of what they should be getting for those prices.

A good category summary describes the property’s type, location, and likely usage.

* Examples:*

-
Property: Large business hotel in a high-rise office complex

*The Continent Bangkok is a modern business hotel located in Bangkok’s CBD is closely situated to the capital’s embassies, premium offices, and high-end retail centers, providing a convenient base for efficient access to the city’s business and leisure activities.*


**Context ****summary**

Every property description should end with a strong selling summary that promotes the property as the ideal setting for the kind of traveler to its features, location, and price will attract.

*Examples:*

-
Property: Large business hotel in a high-rise office complex

*For serious business or just a high-class holiday in the center of this vibrant city, the Continent offers the best in five-star amenities and an unparalleled location that will save you time and effort on every day of your stay.*


|
**Please note that every property description will be reviewed by Agoda for compliance, length, and quality. We reserve the right to edit or reject submitted descriptions that do not follow the guidelines.**
|


**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Can I add operation hours for facilities in the property description?**

We have another section called property policies for such information, you can contact Accommodation Support Team by clicking 'Need Help' button in YCS to add information.

####
**What if there is incorrect information in the automatic-generated property ****description?**

Please kindly let us Accommodation Support Team know --we are happy to assist with corrections.

Not performing any actions on acknowledging the booking does NOT mean that the booking is not confirmed. The property is still expected to honor the booking as reserved by the guest. |


To acknowledge the booking from Agoda, please follow the steps below;

**Promotion Types**


**There are different promotion templates that will help you create different sell strategies. Once you click on any type, you will see the short explanation in the box on the right side.**


Each template has different setup fields. Here are the list of templates and their explanation.

**Customized Promotion**- This template will allow you to enter a range of booking dates, stay dates and a discount that can be either a percentage, fixed amount or free night(s)
**Early Bird / Adv. Purchase** - This is the right template if you want to give a discount to customers who booked early by setting **the minimum number of days to book in advance**. For example, if you set 7 Minimum number of days to book in advance, a customer will be able to book rates with this promotion if they search for a stay at least 7 days before their booking date.
**Last Minute**- This promotion will consider **the maximum number of days in advance** and range of stay date. For example, if you set 7 Maximum number of days in advance, only a customer who booked with stay date within 7 days from their booking date will be able to book the rate with this promotion.

**72-hours Promotion** - This template will be giving a limited time sale offer. The promotion can only be booked for the next number of days (default 3 days).

**Weekend Getaway **- This template will support **the specific day of a week on stay date** and offer discounts for customers who booked on weekend. The default days of the week are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

**Long Stays** - When you need to offer a special discount for customers who stay longer at your property, you can set **Minimum length of stay** within this template. The default length of stay is 3 days.

**After Hours Promotion** - You will have an ability to limit the specific time a booking can be made. As the default booking time is 00:00 am - 06:00 am, customers who made a booking during these time (property local time) will see the rates with this promotion.

**Express Tonight** - This template allows you to sell your last rooms quickly and easily by entering the final selling rate in the promotion.

# How do I change the property name?

**Overview**
**Your ****property name is**** set up based on the information you provided on the registration form.**** ****There ****may ****be some situation****s**** that**** ****require you to change the property name. In this article, we will outline tips for naming your property and how you can request changes****.**

**Tips on naming your property**

Your property name is important to ensure visibility and clarity to Agoda’s customers when searching and selecting their accommodation.

**Some ****things**** ****to avoid****:**

-
**Usage of Abbreviations **
-
An abbreviation will likely confuse the customer and stop them from booking your property since they are not clear about the meaning behind it.

-
**Usage of emojis, symbols or ALL CAPS **
-
Though it might be cute or eye-catching, to make sure your property looks credible, trustworthy and professional, it’s best to avoid unnecessary additions.

-
**Includ****ing a price or promotion **
-
Price and promotions are subjected to change; keeping it updated will be hard since you would need to update every expiring price or promotion. By updating names too often, you may cause repeat customers to miss your property entirely.

-
**Adding translated name in other languages **
-
Adding translation in the brackets will cause duplication. When customers visit Agoda in that specific language version, they will see duplicate names and it won’t look professional. If you have specific translations you prefer, you can share them with us and we will set it for you to be visible on specific Agoda website and app language versions.



**Tips****:**

-
**Keep it short and unique**
-
Compact names are more memorable and easy to recall by travelers.

-
**Include your accommodation type**** **
-
Your name should tell the guest something specific about your place. Including accommodation type will provide more clarity for customer to avoid any misunderstandings.

-
**Capitalize** **T**he **F**irst **L**etter
-
Standard format in Agoda has the first letter only as capitalized. We recommend you to follow this guideline so it will look consistent and match the website design.



**How ****to update property name****s?**

If you would like to update a property name, simply submit your request to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support widget in YCS.



**Frequently Asked Questions**

####
**My property ****name is wrong when the view is in ****ano****ther language (not English). How do I change this?**

You may send us the suggested property name in the language you would like to amend. The Agoda Content team will then confirm the updates before the property name is changed from our end.

To send suggestions, please send the request **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support widget in YCS.

####
**There is another property ****with ****a similar name ****to ****mine****. Can you remove the other property from Agoda?**

Property names should be based on the name used during the business license registration process and certificate. These names should not be duplicated on our website or app. Should you come across this issue, please reach out to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support widget in YCS for our further investigation.

# How to best respond to guest reviews?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010501008-How-to-best-respond-to-guest-reviews

Updated: 2021-08-14T16:40:45Z

**Overview**
**In this article, we’ll show you how to handle the reviews you receive from guests, including the best way to reply to a review, both positive and negative, to create optimal resolution and reputation enhancement. **
#
** Contents**

**Responding to guests’ reviews**

Getting reviews is just the first step in building your property’s online reputation. How you respond to reviews is just as important, as this process represents your ongoing relationship with your guests. Travelers look carefully at the interaction between property and guests, and use it to create an image of you. Our research shows that 85% of travelers agree that a thoughtful response to a review improves their impression of a hotel. There are very few things you can do that have an 85% benefit rate. Don’t miss this opportunity!

That said, proper review response is not always simple. You have to be thoughtful, responsive, and conciliatory if necessary. We’ve prepared some basic tips to guide you.

How to best respond to positive reviews

-
**Thank the guests.**
- Always thank them for their stay, and express how much you appreciate them taking the time to write a review. This immediately demonstrates politeness, professionalism, and service-mindedness.

-
**Be specific and personal.**
- Craft a personalized message to show that you care about each of your guests. Avoid using a standard template reply for every response. Make references to specific items in the review so that it is clear that you read it all the way through.

-
**Be timely and keep it short.**
- Keep your response short and sweet. Do not over-explain your own position or make excuses, and don’t use the response to promote your property.

-
**Emphasize the positives, within reason.**
- Repeat specific things guests say they enjoyed at your hotel to further highlight your positive reputation for potential guests, but don’t be excessive in self-praise.

-
**Double-check before submitting.**
- Take the time to check grammar and spelling and to make sure your tone and message are clear. Double-check the guest’s first name to make sure you spelled it exactly right.

-
**Encourage a return visit.**
- End your reply by expressing hope to serve the guests again on future travels.



**Example of a good response**

|
Dear Nick,
Thank you for your helpful feedback regarding your stay! We are thrilled to know that you loved the experience. Also, thank you for the kind words about our breakfast and staff service. We put a lot of thought into every dish we serve, and are proud of our excellent staff. Your kind words reaffirm the hard work we put in every day.
Thank you for choosing us and we look forward to welcoming you again soon.
Sincerely,
Jenny Kim, Guest Services Manager

###

**Why is this response good?**

- Thanking the guest for taking the time to leave a review.
- Reinforcing the compliments that the guest gave to highlight why your property is a great option for other travelers.
- Ending by thanking the guest again and encouraging a return visit.


**What should not be included in a response?**

- Guest's full name -- just their first name is enough.
- Personal email address and phone number of guest or property.
- Links to other websites.
- Price related references such as room rates.
- Profanity and discriminatory comments.
- OTAs by name

** **

**Responding to negative reviews**

Unfortunately, not all reviews you’ll get will be positive. Even the best properties can’t provide every guest with the perfect stay. At some point, a guest will complain in writing – and it will be posted on your property page.

But there’s no reason to panic – even bad reviews are an opportunity if handled correctly. But you do need to reply quickly and strategically. Never ignore a negative review!

##

**Why respond to negative reviews?**

- Remember -- You're not just replying to just the one guest, but to everyone who reads it, including potential guests.
- Replying shows that you care about feedback and guest satisfaction and have taken steps to ensure this problem won't happen to the next guest.
- Criticism helps you learn what to improve to deliver better guest experiences.

#

#
**How to respond to negative reviews?**

-
**Address the reviewer by name. **
- Your guests want to be heard individually and addressed personally.
- Avoid the generic “Dear guest,” or “Dear customer.”
- Use the first name of the guest only, to respect privacy.

-
**Begin by thanking the reviewer. **
- Express gratitude for taking the time to leave the feedback, even for bad reviews, as it shows the guest and anyone reading that you have a service-minded attitude.
- EXAMPLE:
*“Thank you for your review. I’m sorry to hear you had such a frustrating experience, but we really appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention.”*


-
**Apologize and sympathize.**
- Acknowledge the guest’s bad experience, say sorry, and don’t make excuses for what went wrong.
- Don’t be overly apologetic. Keep your apology sincere and short.
- EXAMPLE:
*“We apologize that our service did not satisfy your expectations.”*
- If possible, make a specific reference to the feelings that the guest expresses. If the guest says the bed was too hard, for example, say
*“We are sorry that the bed was not able to provide optimal sleep.”* This shows that you are listening carefully.


-
**Take responsibility but defend your values.**
- If the negative experience can be attributed to a specific situation, such as a renovation, you can mention it if the situation has been resolved. However, make sure that you still accept responsibility for the experience.
- Insert a little marketing in your response to the bad review -- explain what your customers usually experience and reinforce the company’s standard values.
- EXAMPLE:
*“We’re normally known for our exceptional attention to detail, and we regret that we missed the mark.”*


-
**Make things right and show action**
- If a change or renovation has been made that impacts the situation, be sure to mention it. EXAMPLE:
*“We are sorry that you didn’t find the breakfast adequate. We have since added more food options to the breakfast buffet.” *
- If no change has been made, you can allude to planned changes.
- EXAMPLE:
*“We intend to add more equipment to our fitness center in the near future so that guests will not have to queue for their use.”*
- If the problem has no clear solution, at the very least let them know how you are investigating their complaint to make sure other guests will not have the same experience. EXAMPLE:
*“We can’t fix the past, but you have my personal commitment to improve the way our staff serves every customer. Until then, please accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of everyone on the team.”*


-
**Invite them to come back. **
- After you have addressed the issue and explain your action, ask the guest for another chance so you might offer them a better experience next time. Be welcoming and open, but not specific in the invitation.
- EXAMPLE: We hope you’ll visit us again so that we can show you our improvements based on your valuable feedback.”
-


|
*Please do not include your personal contact information such as phone number and email address in the response.*

# All you need to know about bookings

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012432788-All-you-need-to-know-about-bookings

Updated: 2021-09-27T06:26:46Z

**In this article, you will find information about our bookings and how they get generated**

Agoda provides instant bookings to the guests, therefore you have to keep the rates and allotment up-to-date all time.

Included topics:


We list your property on our website if all of the below criteria meets:


**How do I get the booking vouchers?**

Once a booking is made on your property, the system will automatically send an email to you with the booking voucher. In case you are working with channel manager, you will receive the booking in your PMS as well.

You can also monitor your bookings in our extranet under **Reports** tab in **Bookings**.

Find more detail here about how to acknowledge the bookings.


__Important information__


**How is the total amount calculated?**

Agoda does not send any invoices. We deduct the commission from the total amount paid by guests.

Reference Sell rate = total amount paid by guest

Net rate = total amount without commission

On the right-hand side of the voucher, you can see if there is any other discount applied (promotion, rate channel)



**How can I reply to a special request?**

In case you receive special requests from a guest, and you would like to contact the guests you need to reply the provided email address under Customer Notes at the bottom of the voucher.


**How do I know if there is a cancellation?**

Once a cancellation has been made by a customer, the system will automatically send an email to notify you, with details of a booking and a request link to acknowledge a cancellation request.

The cancellation fee may be charged based on the cancellation policy that you set up.

For **existing Agoda partner****s**, please contact the Channel Manager that you would like to work with. Once the agreement is signed, you or your Channel Manager can send a request to Agoda Accommodation Support to connect you via a Support Widget in the YCS, along with the Channel Manager name.


If you are **not an Agoda partner yet**, please register your property first. Click **here**** **for instructions. You can identify the name of the Channel Manager that you wish to use during the registration process so that you don't need to send the request to connect afterward.


A list of Channel Managers that are able to connect with Agoda, is attached at the end of this page.


Normally, the Channel Manager should provide an error message if your update is unsuccessful. Below are the most common scenarios and how to troubleshoot them.

|
|
|
|
Did not pass system validation -- for example if your Single rate is higher than your Double rate, or any rate is lower than the minimum rate set for that room type. |
Depending on the error, generally, you can fix it by either correcting the data as highlighted in the error message, such as updating the relevant settings in the YCS Room Page. |
|
Technical Issue/Connection Error |
This can be caused by several unpredictable factors. We recommend you wait for a few minutes and try to send the update again. |


In general, a booking notification will still be sent via email from Agoda even if you are connecting through a Channel Manager. In some cases, you may receive a booking confirmation from Agoda but not receive that same booking via the Channel Manager system.

|
|
|
|
Channel Manager's Request API does not cover the booking period |
Please contact your Channel Manager for more information. |
|
Connection issue on Channel Manager or on Agoda |
Agoda will try to push the booking message 3 times for Hint partners. If it still fails, we will send the info via email to your Channel Manager. For non-Hint partners, the Channel Manager will have to send a new request to Agoda when the connection is restored. |


|
|
|
|
To comply with PCI Compliance and GDPR standards, we do not disclose full customer contact details. Instead, we will mask the customer’s email address. |
You can still send an email to the customer using the masked email address Alternatively, you can contact Agoda Customer Service to help you relay a message. |


The process is the same as requesting a connection to the new Channel Manager. Just send the request to **Agoda accommodation support**.


You can contact your Channel Manager for more information. If you need assistance with property settings, contact **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support widget in YCS.

**TIP**: After selecting bank location, you may click save, and the system will highlight any mandatory fields in red.


Fields to be updated:

Once the account is verified it will turn to **Approved** in YCS, and you'll be able to start submitting payments via ePass

Note: In the case of a **Rejected** bank account status, please revise the details and amend that account first before creating a new one. Our Finance team will contact you to confirm which details should be updated.

The nightly price breakdown will only include the sell inclusive amount that you must collect from the guest. This includes commission too, which will later be offset in ePass. (2)

We display the name of the guest that made the booking to have you know who to collect payment from. (4)

YCS Booking Page

On the Reports > Bookings page of YCS you will be able to filter your bookings by payment model (5,6)

The booking summary will also display the payment model as “Property Collect” (7,8)

The first action you will be able to take once a Property Collect booking is confirmed is to verify if the credit card the guest has provided is valid. Clicking ‘Check if guest credit card is valid’ (1) will return an instant result and unlock further actions based on the outcome.

This action is available from the time of the booking until check-in date + 24 hours.


Customers whose credit cards pass this verification are less likely to cancel. If they do cancel and there is a cancellation fee due, charges can usually, but not always, be successfully made to the credit card. This feature is a customer-friendly way of checking if a booking is secure, prior to check-in.

This action is available for Property Collect bookings made with credit card guarantee, from the time of booking until 24 hours after check-in day.

If the first verification fails, you can request a new credit card from the guest or contact them via our messaging service in YCS.

No, if verification fails, you can request a new credit card right away.

This feature can only be used once. If clicked, it will be unavailable for further action. It will also not be available outside the mentioned time window.

This action is available from 7 days before check-in.


Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, is a set of requirements put together by major payment networks including Visa and Mastercard. You must declare your compliance with these requirements to view the guest’s payment card details. You can learn more about PCI DSS here.

This action will only be available if the guest's card verification has been completed. The guest's credit card can be viewed a maximum of 3 times.

No, Agoda's systems do not currently support the sharing of the CVV/CVC number of the guest's payment card.

No. Agoda's Property Collect bookings are strictly pay-at-hotel bookings, you should not collect payment from the guest’s credit card prior to arrival. We understand that in some circumstances you may want to temporarily hold an amount to secure a booking in high occupancy periods, however, this is not guest-friendly, and we advise against it.

You need to have a 'YCS SMS' number set up for your account. You can request this from Agoda Accommodation Support via the support widget in YCS.

If you do not accept the initial payment card of the guest, you can request a new one through the YCS extranet. We also recommend you message the guest to let them know which cards you accept.

It is not possible to view the guest’s payment card details more than 3 times as Agoda systems will automatically clear the data afterward.

If you choose to view the guest's credit card, you will become responsible for collecting any cancellation fees should they occur.

By default, Agoda attempts to collect the cancellation fee from the guest's credit card on your behalf. However, if you view the guest's credit card, Agoda will no longer attempt to collect any fees. This logic was introduced to avoid double charging the guest.

Please note that Agoda UPC cards are restricted to be charged via POS terminals under 7011 merchant category code (MCC) only, Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, Central Reservation Services businesses.

It allows you to create one payment batch for multiple reservations and charge the whole amount from one virtual credit card. Since the card is single-use, the full amount must be charged at once.

If you are on UPC on ePass payment method, you will be able to see the “ePass” menu on YCS. You may visit **How do I log in and begin with ePass?** for details on how you can access the ePass menu.

There are several ways to report a No-Show for bookings, depending on the booking payment method. Agoda offers guests 2 payment options: AGODA COLLECT and PROPERTY COLLECT. Guests may select their preferred payment method during the pre-booking process.


An Agoda Collect booking means that Agoda is responsible for collecting the payment from the guest; in another words, it’s prepaid. We will then pay the property using the payment methods implemented for each property.

Upon booking creation, Agoda will send you a confirmation voucher. An Agoda Collect booking voucher will have a **PREPAID** remarks on it, as below:


You may also refer on** YCS Reports > Bookings** and search for the booking ID/list for the payment model as well.

You have 2 ways to notify us of Agoda Collect No-Show bookings: via call or email. Be sure to include the booking ID when sending the request.

A Property Collect booking means that the property should be collecting payment from the guest upon arrival. Agoda will then deduct the booking commission on ePass from the property.

On the booking confirmation voucher, you will see **TO BE PAID BY GUEST** remarks as below:


As with Agoda Collect bookings, you can also refer to ** YCS Reports > Bookings** and search for the booking ID/list for the payment model.


For Property Collect Bookings, you have the option to mark No-Show without contact to Agoda. See the steps below:


The system will automatically compute the No-Show charge for you.

|
|


No-Shows fees will be collected based on the cancellation policy attached to the booking being reported. On every cancellation policy, a no-show policy will also be included. The fees will then be transferred based on your property’s payment method.

Again, you may view the cancellation policy on the **hotel voucher** or ** YCS > Reports > Bookings**.

**On Hotel Voucher:**


**On YCS Reports > Bookings:**


To change your cancellation policy, you can find more details in this article.


Agoda will attempt to charge the guest’s card stored in our system once a No-Show is reported, given that the property has **NOT** viewed the guest’s credit card details.

Agoda will let you know if the charge was or was not made in the cancellation email. You may visit this article for more detailed information.

**Overview**
**In this article, we will introduce a new payment model called Property Collect, and outline its benefits to you. **
**Contents**
This article includes:
|


Please also find attached the **“Property Collect -- Accommodation Partner Manual”** that will give you further explanation of our new payment program. |


**What is Property Collect**

Property Collect is Agoda’s pay-at-hotel solution. It allows guests to book Agoda’s inventory with payment due directly to you. Complementing Agoda’s prepaid model, it supplies the high demand of customers looking to pay directly upon check-in.


**Why Property Collect?**

-
**Customers love** the flexibility of paying at the hotel
-
**The pay-at-hotel filter** is Agoda’s most frequently used filter for search results
-
**Many customers only book** if they can have payment flexibility
-
**Get more visibility** in search results and through our affiliates and additional marketing
-
**Get more traction** with long lead time customers
- Properties activating Property Collect get on average,
**5% More Bookings**
-
**Option to drive even more bookings** by offering your pay-at-hotel rates without a credit card required (e.g. for low season)
-
**Easily pay** your commission through Agoda’s self-service payment platform, ePass


**Types of Property Collect**

|
**Types **
|
**Features**
|
|
Property Collect - Credit Card Guarantee
|
Guests will provide credit card detail to secure the booking.
|
|
Property Collect without Credit Card
|
Guest can make a reservation without providing credit card details; visit __here__ for more details
|

** **

**How does it work?**

The booking and payment flow of Property Collect are based on Agoda’s prepaid model with a few exceptions:

- Guests will pay the full booking amount directly to you upon check-in.
- You will be able to collect the full selling amount from the guest booking Property Collect.
- Agoda will deduct the commission from your other prepaid bookings to avoid manual invoicing.


**What are the benefits?**

**Simple to Manage**

- Payment for both Prepaid and Property Collect' reservations can be managed from one platform in ePass. Learn more here.
- We understand it's important to you to be able to track your offset commission amounts. You can print out a booking statement for all payments that include Property Collect commissions.

##
**Easy to Get Paid**


- We don't need you to transfer money to us at the end of every month for Property Collect booking commissions. We will take care of that on our end by offsetting the amount you owe us against what we owe you for prepaid reservations. This way it's always you that gets paid.

**More Customers**

- More variety means more solutions. All guests that are looking to pay at check-in can now find this option, which can increase your booking numbers. Attract a wider customer audience, get bookings with longer lead-times, and possibly improve conversion.


**YCS Features**

In YCS, there are four features which you can use to manage Property Collect bookings specifically (only available for Property Collect with credit card)

All Property Collect bookings are confirmed by default. There are, however, scenarios where cancellation is made possible to you based on the guest’s credit card verification status

In case the guest fails to provide a new credit card within 48 hours of the request, or the new credit card provided is also invalid, the action to cancel the booking will be made available. Clicking ‘Request to cancel booking’ (1) will trigger a cancellation email to both you and the guest.

This action is available up to 24 hours before check-in.


The system is going to generate an automatic notification email to the customer when a booking has been canceled.


In case the guest does not show up at your hotels to check in, the action to mark the booking as a no-show will be made available. Clicking ‘Mark booking as no-show’ (2) will cancel the booking and trigger a cancellation email to both you and the guest.

This action will be available from midnight on the check-in day up to 72 hours.

If you failed to report a No-show within 72 hours, the function will be grayed out and you must contact Agoda's Customer Service to report the no-show via **biz@agoda.com****.**


You or Agoda will be responsible for collecting the cancellation fee depending on the actions you have taken on the guest’s credit card verification.

In case you have not used the action to view the guest’s credit card, Agoda will attempt to collect the cancellation fee on your behalf. Canceling the booking or marking it as a no-show will automatically trigger a charge attempt on the credit card, and an email to you with the outcome. If the charge is successful, the amount will be added to ePass.

In case you have used the action to view the guest’s credit card, you will be responsible for collecting any fees upon canceling the booking or marking it as a no-show. You will be able to get in touch with the guest via phone (3) or email (4) through the YCS bookings page



You can cancel a booking if the guest credit card is invalid or if the guest did not provide an alternative payment card. This action is available up to 24 hours before check-in.

No, you cannot reinstate the booking after cancellation.

If you have not viewed the guest’s credit card before canceling, Agoda will attempt to collect any fees on the booking. In case you have used the action to view the card details, you will be responsible for collecting any fees.

No, once a Property Collect booking is canceled, the commission will be removed from ePass.

Updated: 2020-12-23T07:59:14Z

This new setting has been created to address your concerns regarding the limited flexibility of Agoda’s child policy support. This setting allows you to set “free child” limits at the room level.

This new setting ** replaces** the “Free Child Logic” field and both the “Default free children logic” AND “Respect the number of max allowed guests” settings (shown below). This field will be removed from the Property Settings section in favor of the MaxAllowedFreeChildren in an effort to provide greater flexibility to child for your property.

This setting is located in the Room Setup view within the Settings tab.

If you have enabled “Children stay free on existing bedding”, it will have certain YCS settings updated in order to fully enable effective child policies.

**Properties with “Children stay free on existing bedding” enabled and “Respect the number of max allowed guests including free children” selected**:

Updates include:

**Properties with “Children stay free on existing bedding” NOT enabled will now see the new field available with a default setting of Max Allowed Free Children = 0.**


Partners can now update this field within YCS by opening the Room Setup option in the Settings tab. This setting can now be updated for each room.


**1.) Access the Room Setup settings as shown below:**


**2.) Once in Room Setup, update the “Children allowed for free” field to the desired value for each room:**



This new setting is available to all properties, however only properties which currently have “children stay free on existing bedding” enabled will see any noticeable differences as part of the update.

Properties will now be able to indicate exactly how many children can stay for free at the room level. To do this, update the Children allowed for free to the desired value. Note, child guests in excess of this value will be treated as adult guests and subject to standard room occupancy constraints.

This setting will allow properties to customize the maximum number of “free” children per each room – and avoid situations where a guest arrives with too many children.

The following settings will be updated only if you currently have enabled “children stay free on existing bedding”:

Other minor visual / aesthetic changes will be made

**If you do not wish to allow children to stay for free at your property**, please disable the “children stay free on existing bedding” setting.

**If you wish to allow children to stay for free at your property, but want to exclude this benefit from certain rooms**, set the Children allowed for free to “0” for the specified room.

**If you do not wish to allow ANY children to stay at your property**, please update the “Minimum Guest Age” setting to the desired age.

**If you do not wish to allow children to stay in certain rooms**, please update the “Allow children in this room type” setting to “NO”

Updated: 2024-08-28T13:43:42Z

**In this article, we will outline what to do in the case you make a partial charge. **

This article includes:


The card that has been generated from ePass can be charged ONE TIME only, therefore if you didn't charge the full amount of the balance, a partial charge occurs, you will not be able to charge the card again.


If you encounter the below scenarios, means you partially charged the card.

Submitted transaction as bulk but did not charge or authorize the card with full amount

Submitted transaction as bulk but cannot charge full amount due to POS/EDC machine limitation

The payment batch was not charged the full amount and the amount was returned to the Agoda card (Reverse Authorization)

An error occurred on the POS/EDC machine when charged, causing payment to be stuck; bank returned amount back to Agoda card (Reverse Authorization)

Contact your bank for details of the transaction status to find out if it was successfully processed to be returned or reversed

Status reverse authorization might take **up to 14 days** for the amount to be returned to the card

**After 14 days**, contact our support team via the "Help" button in the extranet to request to top up the total remaining balance to ePass




In cases when a payment batch has been created and the card has been authorized, even if the status has not settled yet, the system automatically considers the booking(s)** paid**. Reverse authorization also will not change the **paid** status

Sorry, the payment batch that has been submitted and created cannot be reverted back or canceled.

Cards that have been generated from ePass can be charged **ONE TIME** only**. **Please always charge** FULL AMOUNT **as stated on the payment batch.

Previously, Agoda only allows customers to book up to 30 days. After conducting some studies, we found that a longer period of stays could create more bookings for properties!

We have added this feature on Agoda to allow our partner's businesses to expand with us. This feature will allow customers to book for up to 90 nights on Agoda for your property.


You will be able to manage the maximum number of nights available for bookings on YCS.


If you have received our email notification on the Long Term Rental promotion, you may click on the **"Create Long Stay Promotion"** and the promotion will be activated for 30% discount for bookings more than 28 days.



If you want to get the maximum advantage over your competition, we recommend setting your **discount at 30% for a minimum stay of 28 nights. **


Absolutely! You can deactivate the promotion anytime you like, simply go to Manage - Promotions.


Setting up the discount rate is totally up to you! We recommend 30% to maximum advantage however you can adjust it anytime.

# How to Issue Tax Invoice?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044087734-How-to-Issue-Tax-Invoice

Updated: 2021-09-20T06:55:29Z

**Overview**
**In this article, you will find out factors about tax invoice, when and how you will issue tax invoice to our mutual guests.**
**Content****s**
This article includes:
|


**Do I need to issue a Tax Invoice to the Guest? **

Properties located in all countries** ****except **the US, Mainland China, and Taiwan are liable to issue a tax invoice to guests. A tax invoice can be issued either on paper or email (or both).


**What information is required when issuing a Tax Invoice to Guests?**

1. Hotel name

2. Guest full name

3. Amount exclusive of GST/VAT

4. GST/ VAT

5. Total Amount: Reference Sell Rate (All-inclusive amount incl. tax & fees)*


** Please refer to the Agoda property voucher for the Reference Sell Rate*



**Sample of a Tax Invoice**

The below sample is for illustrations purpose only, please do not use this template. The exact Tax Invoice template will depend on the VAT/GST laws of the country where your property is located.


#
**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What if my property is tax exempted by the government?**


The law and regulations in different countries and areas may vary. If your property has a special status, kindly reach out to Agoda Accommodation Support via the Support widget in YCS.

**Why Agoda is not issuing the tax invoice?**

__A) Law__

Please note under local law, the property is required to issue local VAT invoices to guests specifying the room rate (Reference Sell Rate)

__B) Legal contract signed by Property and Agoda__

Under our agreement with your hotel, you shall issue a tax invoice to the guest (when they request) specifying the reference sell rate.

__C) Transaction model__

Please note that Agoda collects the money on behalf of you and makes the payment after deducting our commission. This is no different if the guest pays the room rate to you directly and you send the commission amount to Agoda.

__D) Role of Agoda__

Agoda is a “booking facilitation service/ middleman/agent” – legally we do not provide hotel rooms, thus we earn only the commission for our service. Under local law, the provider of accommodation service (hotel rooms) needs to issue a tax invoice to the guest.

**L'approche d'Agoda **

La protection de nos clients et de nos partenaires est primordiale pour Agoda. Nous avons suivi de près les dernières informations disponibles sur le coronavirus et les conseils officiels destinés aux voyageurs afin d'évaluer les répercutions de la situation sur nos clients et partenaires. Actuellement, les voyages en provenance, à destination et à l'intérieur des régions touchées ont été sévèrement affectés et même interdits dans certaines régions.

Selon les derniers conseils officiels adressés aux voyageurs concernant le coronavirus, il est peu probable que les clients puissent séjourner, se rendre ou revenir de leur lieu d'hébergement dans les régions du monde qui sont touchées. Outre les zones touchées par l'épidémie, les interdictions de voyager annoncées par les gouvernements de certains pays ou de certaines régions ont également des répercussions sur les voyageurs en provenance du monde entier.

Cet article à pour but de confirmer quelles zones et quelles périodes sont concernées par les exemptions d'annulation d'Agoda dans le cadre de la pandémie de la COVID-19. Cette information est basée sur des renseignements obtenus localement. Pour pouvoir accéder à un guide de voyage officiel, nous vous recommandons de consulter les sites web mis en place par les gouvernements.

**MISE À JOUR IMPORTANTE :** Un certain temps s'étant écoulé depuis l'apparition de la pandémie, nous présumons que clients et hôtels partenaires sont maintenant parfaitement conscients des risques liés aux voyages. Ainsi, les réservations effectuées à partir du **10 avril 2020** ne donneront droit à aucune exonération de frais. Toute demande d'annulation ou de modification se fera conformément aux conditions de réservation normales.

**Vorgehensweise von Agoda **

Der Schutz von Kunden und Partnern ist für Agoda von höchster Wichtigkeit. Wir beobachten die Coronavirus-Updates und die neuesten offiziellen Reisehinweise genau, um die Auswirkungen auf unsere Kunden und Partner zu bewerten. Gegenwärtig sind Reisen aus und zu betroffenen Regionen sowie innerhalb betroffener Regionen stark beeinträchtigt und in bestimmten Regionen ganz verboten.

Laut den neuesten offiziellen Reisehinweisen zum Coronavirus ist es weltweit unwahrscheinlich, dass Kunden zu Unterkünften in den betroffenen Gebieten reisen bzw. von dort ausreisen können. Abgesehen von den vom Ausbruch direkt betroffenen Gebieten wirken sich die von der Regierung bestimmter Länder oder Regionen angekündigten Reiseverbote auch auf Gäste aus der ganzen Welt aus.

Der Zweck dieses Artikels besteht darin, Sie darüber zu informieren, für welchen Zeitraum und für welche Gebiete Agoda aufgrund von COVID-19 auf die Stornierungsgebühr verzichtet. Die hier zusammengestellten Daten stammen aus lokalen Quellen. Für offizielle Reisehinweise empfehlen wir Ihnen, die offiziellen Webseiten der jeweiligen Regierung aufzusuchen.

**Pendekatan Agoda **

Menjaga keselamatan pelanggan dan partner merupakan hal yang sangat penting bagi Agoda. Kami memantau dengan saksama kabar terbaru mengenai Virus Corona dan saran perjalanan resmi terbaru untuk menilai dampak pada pelanggan dan partner kami. Saat ini, perjalanan dari, ke, dan dalam wilayah terdampak sudah sangat terpengaruh dan bahkan dilarang di beberapa wilayah tertentu.

Mengikuti saran perjalanan resmi terbaru terkait Virus Corona, pelanggan tidak dimungkinkan untuk melakukan perjalanan ke, dari dan menginap di akomodasi yang berada di wilayah terdampak di seluruh dunia. Selain wilayah yang terkena dampak wabah, larangan perjalanan yang diumumkan oleh pemerintah negara atau wilayah tertentu juga berdampak pada tamu yang melakukan perjalanan dari seluruh dunia.

Tujuan artikel ini adalah untuk mengonfirmasi area dan periode yang termasuk dalam pembebasan biaya pembatalan Agoda di tengah COVID-19. Informasi berikut berdasarkan intelijen yang mengandalkan sumber lokal. Untuk panduan perjalanan resmi, kami menyarankan agar Anda memeriksa situs resmi pemerintah.

**INFORMASI PENTING TERBARU:** Karena sudah cukup lama sejak wabah pandemi, kami harap pelanggan dan partner hotel mengetahui dengan baik risiko perjalanan saat ini. Dengan demikian, pesanan yang dibuat mulai** 10 April 2020** dan seterusnya tidak akan mendapatkan pembebasan biaya. Semua pembatalan atau permintaan perubahan akan mengikuti kebijakan pemesanan standar. |

**Enfoque de Agoda **

La protección de los clientes y socios es de suma importancia para Agoda. Hemos estado monitorizando de cerca las actualizaciones de coronavirus y los últimos consejos oficiales de viaje para evaluar el impacto en nuestros clientes y socios. En la actualidad, los viajes desde, hacia y dentro de las regiones afectadas se han visto gravemente afectados y prohibidos en ciertas regiones.

Siguiendo los últimos consejos oficiales de viaje sobre el coronavirus, es poco probable que los clientes puedan viajar a, desde y permanecer en sus alojamientos en áreas afectadas en todo el mundo. Aparte de las zonas afectadas por el brote, las prohibiciones de viaje anunciadas por el gobierno de determinados países o áreas también están afectando a los huéspedes que viajan desde todo el mundo.

El propósito de este artículo es confirmar qué áreas y períodos están dentro de las exenciones de cancelación de Agoda a causa del COVID-19. Esta información se basa en la inteligencia de origen local. Para la guía de viaje oficial, le recomendamos que consulte los sitios web oficiales del gobierno.

Por lo tanto, las reservas realizadas a partir del **10 de abril de 2020** en adelante no tendrán derecho a exención de pago.

# What is Occupancy Model Display Setting?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045316413-What-is-Occupancy-Model-Display-Setting

Please note that you have to be logged into YCS to make these changes, you can find how to do this here.

This article is available in; Thai, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese & Simplified Mandarin

This is a new functionality that allows rates to be added based on the actual occupancy of the room, and will mean that existing rates will be adapted to a per person occupancy format in the new YCS calendar. This will be available for YCS desktop only for the time being.

You may be part of the test roll-out on April 6th If not, you will see this change when rolled out globally mid-April.


**Example**

**If you have a room with a maximum occupancy of 5 and rates are loaded as single = 1200 / double = 1300 / full = 1400, the new YCS calendar will display rates as follows:**

**1 person = 1200 / 2 people = 1300 / 3 people = 1400 / 4 people = 1400 / 5 people = 1400**


All rates, allotments and restrictions that were previously loaded into the calendar will not be wiped, and will remain in place.

If your Channel Manager doesn't support occupancy based pricing, rates can be sent from Channel Managers using existing Full Occupancy Models. The new YCS calendar will display the updates from Channel Managers per occupant.

Rates will be sold as they were updated in the calendar, even if your Channel Manager doesn’t support Occupancy Based Pricing. If the Channel Manager attempts to get the most updated rates and allotment from Agoda, they will be able to receive single / double / full rates. Full will be equal to the rate for maximum occupancy.


To access the new features of the YCS calendar

a) Login to YCS as normal

b) Navigate to the calendar page by selecting "View" from the Rate & Allotment menu.

c) Select a single date or range of dates and click on the advanced tab on the right hand side of the screen.

d) Within the advanced tab, scroll down to a rate plan and then select "Edit Price Based on Occupancy"

e) You have now accessed the new features of the new version of the YCS calendar. Continue with one of the sections below to update rates.


**Note about discount per occupancy**: "Discounting" for the new calendar works by using the full occupancy rate as the base price. The discount % from the maximum occupancy is increased by the base discount % for each descending occupancy.

**Example**

**If a room has a maximum occupancy of 3 and the full occupancy rate is 100 USD and the discount is 10% then the per occupancy rate would be as follows.**

**3 People: 100 USD**

**2 People: 100 - 10 = 90**

**1 Person: 100 - (10 x 2 ) = 80**


a) Set a rate for the full occupancy of the room

b) Set the discount per unit of unused occupancy

c) The rate per occupant will automatically be filled in.

d) click save rates

**Note about discount per occupancy**: "Discounting" for the new calendar works by using the full occupancy rate as the base price. The discount amount from the maximum occupancy is increased by the base discount amount for each descending occupancy.


**Example**

**If a room has a maximum occupancy of 3 and the full occupancy rate is 100 USD and the discount amount is 10 USD then the per occupancy rate would be as follows.**

**3 People: 100 USD**

**2 People: 100 - (100 -10) = 90**

**1 Person: 100 - ((100 - (10 x 2 )) = 80**


a) Set the rate for full occupancy of the room

b) set the discount per unit of unused occupancy

c) The rate per occupant will be automatically filled in

d) click save rates

**Note about setting a specific discount per person**: A discount for an occupancy level can't be left blank, and can't be negative. It is however possible to set a specific occupancy level at a discount percentage / amount higher or lower than the preceding or following occupancy level.

**Example 1: **

Base Price: 10,000

| 1 | 1,000 | 9,000 |



a) Set a rate for full occupancy of the room

b) fill in the rate per occupant.

c) click save rates.


It is possible to load rates for partial occupancy. The calendar will display rate data for the occupancy level it has received.

# Introduction to EasyCancel

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045966733-Introduction-to-EasyCancel

Updated: 2021-09-11T05:46:03Z

Given the current COVID-19 crisis, our data indicates a willing segment of travellers who are looking to book, but are reluctant because of uncertainty around future travel restrictions.

We found that this could be an opportunity to provide more bookings to our partners, thus the launch of this new campaign.



In response to the overwhelming success of this program and the positive impact it has on our partners and customers, EasyCancel will become a permanent program.

Until now, EasyCancel has been used on a temporary basis. The current version applies until 15 December. For properties that do not opt-out of the next extension, EasyCancel will apply to all existing and future bookings (no check-in date cut off). You can contact us at any time to request EasyCancel to be deactivated.


In addition to extending the program indefinitely, we will also be adjusting the cancelation policy to align with how other OTAs set their flexible cancelation policies and to make it easier for our customers to understand.


To advertise and improve the visibility of your property on Agoda, we will highlight properties who agree to join this campaign by displaying a badge with EasyCancel remarks for customers.

The badge will be as below:


We've made it easy for you to join this campaign! Should you agree to join this EasyCancel campaign, you can simply follow one of the options below!


If your property has received an email from Agoda with the subject line **“Introducing Agoda EasyCancel - supporting partners & customers”**, there is a link in that email for you to click and join.

If you have not received any email, we have also sent you an invitation via YCS. You will see this pop-up on YCS which you may click to join.

If you know your market manager, please reach out to them directly.

Otherwise, reach out to our support team by clicking on the **blue **Support button on YCS. They will assist you to sign up for this feature.


The cancellation policy will be updated to the current EasyCancel policy.


The cancellation policy will revert to the old cancellation policy set by the property before this campaign.


No, for the changes on cancellation policy to 1 day before check-in will be implemented ONLY for new booking created after 4 January 2020.


Unfortunately, this is not a possible option for this campaign. You may set that using YCS directly should you wish to do so, but no badge will be given as it does not fit the campaign criteria.


You can either find the invitation on your YCS dashboard or email us using the blue Support button.

# What my allotment is reopened (Auto Topup)?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046259594-What-my-allotment-is-reopened-Auto-Topup

Updated: 2021-08-21T10:09:57Z

Auto Top-up (ATU) is a feature on YCS to ensure that your property will always have availability to sell without the needs of going to YCS and fill up your allotment manually. This can help your property to reduce redundant works and save up your precious time. This feature will be made available globally on 1st of May 2020.

ATU is a feature that allows you to present minimum number of regular allotments that should be available based on the total number of rooms that have been set on YCS room setup page. If the number of regular allotments (on the Calendar page) goes below this number, the system will automatically top-up to this value.

By default, we set the top-up level to one room. This means that if your availability for a specific room type drops below one, we will add another room. We will do this each time the number of available rooms drops below one, until we reach the total number of rooms you have (based on the settings for that room type on the Room Set Up page).

You can activate ATU in the dashboard tab in YCS



Yes, you will be notified via email each time we automatically top up your allotment.

You can view these values in YCS. Navigate to menu: Settings > Room Setup. You will see the value under, under the Occupancy Settings.

No, if you close out inventory, the Auto Top Up feature will not initiate. To avoid any errors, make sure to close out the regular allotment, rather than updating inventory to 0.

No worries! This feature is not functioning with guaranteed allotment.

Auto Top Up is not available for channel managed properties.

If you do not want us to increase the Auto Top Up setting to **one** for all room types, you can opt-out of this change by contacting your MM or Accommodation Services Team

In the event that the announcement or policy contains information that does not align with Agoda's policy (ie: discrimination against specific groups, display of property direct contacts), we may reject the request.


**How to Request to Upload/Deletion/Edit Property Policy or Announcement**

You can submit your request via the support button on your YCS page. One of our teams will assist you from there.

# How do I Handle Overcharges?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047000614-How-do-I-Handle-Overcharges

Updated: 2021-09-20T06:55:55Z

#
**Overview**

**In this article, we will outline why you may have a negative balance, and what you can do to correct it. You may also find the video example attached below for further references.**

#
**Contents**

This article includes:

#

**What is Overcharge?**

- An “overcharge” is defined as any instance where you have charged Agoda more than what was supposed to be paid and therefore Agoda needs to recover the surplus amount back.
- Overcharge includes but not limited to:

**Overcharge Reason** |
**Scenario** |
| Cancellations / Amendments outside policy |
If your payment terms are before check-in date, you have charged an Agoda UPC and there is a cancellation / amendment by customer outside policy, this will result in an overcharge, requiring collection. |
| Cancellations / Amendments inside policy |
When you agree to refund the customer on a non-refundable booking, it can result in an overcharge. |
| Others |
Fraud, force-charges, manual entry errors etc. |

#

**Reasons why you may have a negative balance?**

An overcharge is when you have charged more than the total amount that is due to you and this can result in your account having a negative balance.

ePass will only allow you to submit positive batches, and you will receive an error message if you try to submit a batch with a negative balance.

You may see a manual adjustment posted by our Finance team, which could be due to:

- Overcharging related to multi-currency transactions
- Outdated tax rate on bookings
- Agreements to allow customer to cancel with different cancellation policy than on original booking
- Cancelled or No Show Booking is charged with full payment before status updated on YCS

##

**Have you recently changed Payment Method?**

If you have recently migrated to ePass from another payment method, there may be some payments that cannot be migrated to ePass. This is due to a system limitation and if this happens, our Finance team will post an adjustment to reflect the missing balance. You will be able to include this in your next payment batch.

##

**Have you submitted payment for a booking before the status is finalized?**

When booking status changed to canceled or no show, the payment that eligible for you to charge will be updated depending on the cancellation policy setup. If you have charged the booking before the status updated, Agoda may adjust by posting a negative amount to balance the amount.

You may check headlines “How will an Overcharge be cleared?” if you are not on ePass.

If you are on ePass, you can check on YCS if you receive the negative amount to balance by following the steps below:

- When you receive the negative amount, find your Booking ID and keep it in mind.
- Go to
**ePass** > **All Transactions**
- Search the booking transaction (can be based on check-in, check-out, or booking date), click
**Search**
- Find the specific Booking ID.
- When you find on the Booking ID has more than 1 posted amount, and 1 of them is negative it means Agoda has balanced out the payment. Check the article “How do I review past payments?” to check detail on previously submitted payments.


**How will an Overcharge be cleared?**

Our Finance team will contact you and will arrange for the overcharge to be cleared by manually amending the system, or if you are on UPC payment method, amending the UPC batch or issuing a new UPC to charge.

**Collection Process for UPC Payment Method**

- Every Monday, the system pulls overcharges report at a booking level, generates a PDF invoice on Hotel ID (HID) level, and emails an invoice to
__all contact details__ for the hotel ID available in YCS.
- The invoice will request you to refund the overcharges detailed at a booking level onto the same UPCs you have charged, and specifically mentioned a 2-week timeline to refund to avoid a chargeback by Agoda.

**Collection Process on UPC on ePass Payment Method**

- Only when the overcharge remaining more than 60 days in Epass. Every Monday, the system pulls overcharges at a batch level, it generates a PDF invoice on Hotel ID level, and emails an invoice to all contact details for your hotel available in YCS.
- The invoice will request property to refund the overcharges detailed at a booking level onto the same UPCs you have charged, and specifically mentioned a 2-week timeline to refund to avoid a chargeback by Agoda.

In any case at this stage we recommend you to respond back to original email or contact at: Collections@agoda.com


**Chargeback**

- If you did not refund in 2-weeks and collection agents do not have information to show the relevant overcharges were due to internal errors, an auto-chargeback is initiated.
- Upon chargeback, Agoda gets the money back within 1-2 days through your acquiring bank. You then has the right to dispute the chargeback (through your acquiring bank) if you believe that money was not owed to Agoda but you have to provide some documentary evidence proving this to your acquiring bank. If you dispute chargeback, you will receive the money back through your bank until such time as Agoda decides to counter your dispute.
- In the event Agoda gets a dispute from you which is routed to Agoda through our issuing bank, Agoda also has the right to counter your dispute if the chargeback team believes there is sufficient evidence to show Agoda has the right to recover the money. If neither Agoda nor you agree, the final stage is arbitration where the relevant card scheme gets involved to resolve dispute.
- Chargeback process has costs for both Agoda and properties which increase with disputes. We prefer not charging back, but having properties to refund voluntarily when they receive an invoice.

In any case after you received chargeback from the bank, please contact us at AC-Chargeback@agoda.com


**Resuming payment processing**

If you have a negative balance, you can submit a batch to make your balance positive again. There may be cases when the batch decreases the negative amount but the overall balance remains negative. In the example below, no UPC will be issued as the balance remains negative

**In the example below, you can see a case where the batch does not fully clear the outstanding balance**

After you have cleared this negative balance, you will be able to charge future bookings as per usual process.

**In the example below, you can see an example of a negative balance being cleared**

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**My property is under ePass, Can I pay the overcharge amount via bank transfer and remove the negative amount in ePass?**


Sorry, due to financial restrictions, the overcharge amount has to be balanced out via the same payment method.


**I have a negative balance but I don't have issues mentioned above.**

In this case, please reach out to Agoda accommodation support via the Support widget in YCS. We will do a further investigation with relevant teams.


**Can Agoda cancel a chargeback once initiated?**

Sorry, but there is no option to cancel a chargeback. Once a chargeback is initiated, it will result in Agoda getting the money back immediately within 1-2 days.


**I have received chargeback but its overcharges are already recovered through Epass. What can I do?**

There is a slim possibility where you received bookings offsetting the overcharge just before chargeback was raised (timing lag) or there is a data issue, resulting in a double charge from Agoda. There are 2 options in this case:

Bank transfer settings are handled in the extranet under the ePass section. To be able to charge bookings through Bank transfer, the extranet (YCS) needs to be connected to your bank account.

You must first set up and manage the bank account to which you will receive payments. The bank account has to be approved by Agoda Finance before you will be able to receive payments.

Once you have provided your bank account details to us via YCS, the status of the account will be displayed as Pending. You then need to provide supporting documents to the Agoda Finance team via email (Biz@agoda.com), once bank account details and supporting documents have been verified by the Agoda finance team, your bank account status will be changed to Approved, and you can now start charging for your bookings.

The step-by-step guide on how to set up your bank account can be foundin **How do I Set Up my Bank Account in ePass?**

6. You will see another message indicating that the payment will be settled and the amount will be sent to your bank account within 10 business days. Please press **Settle **to complete the payment.

If your booking has been amended or canceled, Agoda will send you an amendment email (with “AMENDED” appearing in the subject line) with an amended hotel voucher or cancellation email notification, including information about the eligible cancellation fee.

This updated amount will be reflected immediately for the relevant booking displayed on the current transactions page.

**How can I charge amended bookings?**

We will send you an amendment email (with “AMENDED” appearing in the subject line) with an amended hotel voucher attached confirming that a reservation has changed.

Kindly charge the booking amount as stated in that amended hotel voucher.

You will also be able to identify the amended booking on the *YCS > Report > Bookings* if the font color on the “Booking ID: XXX” is yellow. If the booking is amended, the booking amount stated in YCS will also follow the latest update.



#
**How can I charge canceled bookings?**

Any payment that you will receive for a canceled reservation is determined by the cancellation policy in force at the time of reservation. You should charge the UPC **only for the amount permitted by the cancellation policy**.

-
Agoda will send you a cancellation email (with “CANCELLED” appearing in the subject line) confirming that a reservation has been canceled.
-
The new UPC “Amount Payable” will be included in the body of the cancellation email. This amount payable is determined based on the cancellation policy and is the amount you should charge to the UPC for the canceled reservation.

Ensure the correct credit card number is being entered.

Check that the credit card was
**not pre-authorized** by one of your colleagues (pre-authorized cards will become invalid).
-
Ensure the correct amount (as seen on the hotel voucher) is being charged. Any additional amount will cause the transaction to be declined.
-
Any booking that is canceled without any cancellation fee cannot be charged.
-
The charge attempt must be
** within 150 days** after the check-out date as the card will expire after this 150 days period. It is important that you charge the UPC on time.
- If you do not charge us for a booking for more than 150 days after departure date, the booking will be removed from the system and the payment will no longer be available for you to claim.

**There are 4 payment method options that you can choose from to receive payments from Agoda. One of the options is using a physical card, also known as plastic card, or an e-Card. In this article, we will provide information about the e-Card payment method and how to troubleshoot any issues.**


This article includes:

** **


The e-Card is a physical credit card or a plastic card that Agoda provides to you for charging all eligible booking amounts using the ePass system. Please note that Agoda e-Cards are restricted to be charged via POS terminals under 7011 merchant category code (MCC) only, namely Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, or Central Reservation Services businesses.

When you receive your e-Card, you will have to confirm receipt by contacting our ecard@agoda.com. You will receive instructions on how to do this when you receive your e-Card.

Your e-Card information will also be stored at ** YCS > ePass > My Payment Accounts **once it has been activated.

The e-Card that you received will not contain any amount until booking transactions have been submitted on ePass. Please charge your e-Card with the same currency and the exact approved amount to avoid undercharging or overcharging.

Your e-Card will also have an expiry date, please check to ensure that you only submit payments while holding a valid e-Card.

6. Go to *YCS >** Epass > Remittances*, and wait until a new batch is created.

7. Once the batch has been created, you may need to wait for 15 minutes and up to 2 hours in some cases before you are able to charge your e-Card on your POS terminal.

8. You can then proceed to use your e-Card on your POS terminal.

9. All payments that have been approved will be removed from the current transactions page. These transactions can be viewed on the **All transactions** page for future reference.

10. If you forget to record the card details, or you would like to review the card and transaction details, you can view them on the Remittances page. Visit **How do I Review Past Payments?** for more information on how to access.

|


If your booking has been amended or canceled, Agoda will send you an amendment email (with “AMENDED” appearing in the subject line) with an amended hotel voucher or cancellation email notification including information about the eligible cancellation fee.

This updated amount will be reflected immediately for the relevant booking displayed on the current transactions page.


These are the 3 most common errors and how you can troubleshoot them:

|
|
|
|
|
Insufficient Funds |
Attempting to charge before the amount has been updated |
Please wait at least 15 minutes between approval and charging |
|
Bookings have not been approved before charging the card |
Please approve and submit booking transactions on ePass first |
|
|
Attempting to charge an amount greater than the approval amount on Remittances page |
Please make sure to review and ensure that you charge only the total approved amount for each batch |
|
|
Security Violation |
More than 5 failed attempts to charge the card |
Please wait for 1 hour before attempting to charge again, and make sure you charge with the correct details and a stable internet connection. |
|
Card Blocked FRE 10 |
Temporary block due to suspicious transaction |
Please note that a card will be blocked if you attempt to use the card for any activity outside of booking related payments. You will need to contact the Agoda accommodation support team and explain the incident before we can remove the block. |


If you receive any error message that is not mentioned here, please contact Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS.


You may dispute each incorrect transaction on the ** YCS > ePass > Current Transactions > Booking Transactions**, visit

Rest assured! You are still able to charge the card again with the remaining amount that has not yet been charged. You would need to calculate the remaining amount by checking the Total Approved Amount on the Remittances page and subtracting the amount you have already charged from it.

This error message means that your POS terminal is not under the 7011 merchant category code (MCC). We recommend that you always use a POS terminal with 7011 MCC; you may contact your POS terminal provider for further information on MCC code set-up. If you have difficulty changing your MCC code, please contact Agoda accommodation services via the Need Help button in YCS to report your issue.


It is important to understand that you are required to collect payment within the 150-day deadline. You can contact Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS for assistances.


You may reach out to Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS and request for a replacement card.

Agoda offers **instant confirmed bookings** to customers, which means Agoda guarantees that a guest will be able to stay in the room at the property that they booked. However, there are certain cases where a hotel rejects the booking or is unable to accommodate the guest.

We highly suggest that all properties should honor all bookings if possible. Any rejection may:

As stated on **Agoda’s term and conditions**, you will also be responsible for all the costs that your guest might incur due to a booking rejection. You can see more details in Booking rejection costs


This occurs when multiple reservations are made for the same room on the same night at your property where additional availability is not available anymore. The two most common causes are:


When you fail to update the rate on the platform or you forget to deactivate a promotion that is no longer applicable, this may result in an incorrect rate being sold and booked by a customer.

You can also refer to the article **How to calculate a booking rate?** for tips on these calculations.


**Here are some tips for avoiding Double Booking/Overbooking**** ****and Incorrect Rat****es****:**


This may occur if you don’t update to the most current content such as property cancellation policy, child policy, or facilities. To make sure you are up to date, please find guidance on how you can update** ****restrictions** or **facilities**.


If you don’t close out your availability during a closure or renovation period, you may receive a booking you cannot accommodate. Please make sure to plan ahead and close your availability according to your renovation timeline.


Your decision to deactivate your listing on Agoda temporarily or permanently will likely impact bookings. Following Agoda terms and conditions, honoring bookings is strongly encouraged.

To avoid rejection of any new incoming bookings, we recommend you plan ahead and make sure to close your availability at least 30 days before deactivation.


If your hotel is not able to accommodate a guest with a confirmed booking, you should offer alternatives. It is important to act quickly to make sure the guest is not left without any accommodation.

For alternative accommodation places, we recommend helping organize transport to the new accommodation. You can contact you, customer, directly to inform them on these arrangements -- click **here** to find out how.

If you have issues contacting the customer, please request the Agoda Customer Service team to notify the guest. Kindly provide following details:

As mentioned, any booking rejection will result in penalties applied to your hotel.

Depending on what you’re able to offer your guest, the cost that you might need to cover is equivalent to at least 1 night’s average nightly value of the booking. You can find details here at *YCS>**Help>**Terms and Conditions**.*

This cost will be charged to your property later, depending on the payment method used by your property.


You can report it to **Agoda Accommodation Support** team via the Support widget in YCS. We will then investigate the issue and confirm with you on any solution we can offer.

You can choose the closest correct reason available under “Booking related.”

We would still strongly recommend you honor the booking if that option is possible, to make sure the guest will have the best experience.


Providing a suitable alternative is strongly recommended; however if no alternative is possible, you may cancel the booking and inform that you won’t be able to provide any alternatives to** Agoda Customer Service**.

**Agoda Customer Service** can be contacted via email at **biz@agoda.com** or by calling the phone number stated on the hotel voucher (depending on your area).

# Tips on finding and choosing your room name

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050489453-Tips-on-finding-and-choosing-your-room-name

A standard room name shows the most important information when comparing rooms such as room type, class, location, and any attribute which is not supported in the room setup.

Examples:

By standardizing the room names, we offer more clarity for guests and avoid potential misunderstanding. The better the user experience, the higher chance you can convert potential guests to real bookings.

Thousands of standard names are **translated into 37 languages**, ready to use and ensure consistency across the website. These provide the easiest, simplest, and fastest way to start selling your rooms right away.


Check out some useful tips to quickly find a room name that suits your needs.

Search the **key element that you need** to have in the room name (e.g. "Deluxe Room")

Combine the key element with **another class/term** to narrow down the search results. The second term must be connected with the main class (e.g. "Executive Deluxe")


Add the **accommodation type** (e.g. "Dormitory")

We allow up to 100-character names, but do remember **the shorter, the better**! As the name gets longer, it is more difficult for your potential customers to see the whole name, especially on mobile display.

| Too Long, hard to read | |
| Short and Clear |


Some of the elements on the room names guidelines are available option on YCS:

**Find out more on the**** attached pdf below.**

*Most elements can be found under Settings in Room Setup or added using Rate Plans Setup on YCS.*



We know size does matter, but that’s not the case with room names! There’s a better place to show this information. Simply go to the **Room Setup menu on ****YCS** and fill in the blanks. When the room goes live, it will communicate its main points without overloading the traveler with too much information.


You can set up the information related to breakfast or promotion with better visibility! For breakfast, you can update the benefit according to the rate plan that is offered on Rate Plan page. For promotions, you can simply create it from the Promotion page.


As much as we would like to help you, room name is not the ideal place to show information about Single or Double rates. The reason is simple --we don’t want customers to miss essential information. If you show it in the room name, the chance is high it won’t be visible, especially when it’s combined with longer names. The YCS Rate Plan is the perfect place for this setting.


Don’t worry – our system is always designed to show the information needed while keeping the name consistent. If you’re sure there’s no better option on the dropdown list, then you can request a new room name by sending the request to **Agoda accommodation support **via the Support widget in the YCS.

Whether the occasion is planned or unplanned, Agoda **strongly encourages you to honor** every booking that has been made from Agoda customers at your property. This means that every booking that is made, even during the closing period, would need to be accommodated.

Any bookings that can’t be accommodated should be offered alternative accommodation. You can find more detailed steps in this article: **What should I do if I can’t accommodate a guest?**

Please note that if you can’t provide any alternatives, you must compensate Agoda to cover the costs of relocation for guests.


To temporarily remove your listing, we recommend you to **simply**** close your availability** for the time required in YCS. You can visit **How do I manage my availability?** for more detailed steps.

If you use **channel manager or other connectivity support**, please make sure to update your availability using your designated connectivity platform. This is to avoid unsuccessful updates on the availability if you only update on YCS.

For properties under agreement with Agoda that include guaranteed availability or allotment, you will be required to request an update to your Market Manager or to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support Widget in the YCS.


You may contact your Market Manager or to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support Widget in the YCS to request temporary closure. If you don’t have access to YCS or are not using connectivity platforms. We will help you to temporarily unlive the listing.

Please note that if you are using this method, you will need to contact us again when would like to re-live your listing as well.

# How do I calculate my booking rates?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051821373-How-do-I-calculate-my-booking-rates

Updated: 2024-08-28T14:14:00Z

At Agoda, there are 3 different rates that you may encounter:


Agoda’s default rate load type is Sell-Inclusive, which is the total rate including taxes, fees, and Agoda's commission. We will then provide you information on the amount to which you are entitled with Net-Inclusive details, which is total rate after Agoda’s commission, including taxes and fees.

Let’s take a look at an example below to see how a rate is loaded on YCS, depending on the options selected.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
100 |
100 |
85 |


There are 2 discount model types, which provide you more pricing options to show customer and boost bookings.

Agoda’s default setting would be the **Additive discount model** type. However, depending on your agreement or requests, your property may be under the Multiplicative discount model type.

If you wish to change your discount model type, you may contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS.


Before starting the calculation, you will need to check all the data needed:

|
Please note that if the promotion is set with “Stackable promotion,” multiple promotions may be stacked and applied to the booking if all the promotion requirements are met at the time of booking. For more information, see How do I manage my promotions? |


Since Agoda’s hotel booking vouchers will always show the total Net Inclusive booking rate to you, you can use the formula below to find the calculation breakdown by converting the data above.


|
|
|
|
Sell Inclusive |
|


Example Scenario:

|
1. Sell inclusive loaded rate |
|
|
2. 10% Stackable promotion + |
USD 100 - 15% = |
|
3. 20% Channel discount |
USD 85 - 20% = |
|
4. 15% Commission |
USD 68 - 15% = |


|
|
|
|
Sell Inclusive |
|


Example Scenario:

|
1. Sell Inclusive loaded rate |
|
|
2. 10% promotion + |
USD 100 - 35% = |
|
3. 15% Commission |
USD 65 - 15% = |


You may contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS to request applying a different rate load type to match your requirement.

Please note even if a rate load type is updated to match your requirement, calculation on the booking voucher will still be under the Inclusive rate, which included taxes and fees.


Before reporting, please make sure that you calculate the loaded rate and discount when the booking is made. Any update after a booking is created will not be reflected in the existing booking.

If you have used the all correct data and still find the price incorrect, contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS.

It’s all the information in your property listing -- including facilities, amenities, services, reviews, and pictures. It also includes additional information like policies, notes, and your property’s description.

The quality and completeness of your content will determine how many bookings you get. Travelers search Agoda every day for their perfect property. The accommodation they choose will most likely be the ones with the content that matches their needs, and what they are looking for in an ideal stay.

**Remember: For travelers, your content IS your property. **

Since most travelers tend to compare similarly priced properties when booking, each property’s content creates perceived value for that same price. Every item you include in your content might make the difference between getting a booking or missing a booking.

The Content Score is Agoda’s convenient overall measure of content health for your property listing on Agoda. You can refer to the Content Score at any time as an easy way for you to see if there are any areas where your content is missing and could be improved.

The Content Score is measured by combining 4 elements:

Property level content refers to the common features and offerings of your property that are **accessible to** **all guests**, such as swimming pools, fitness facilities, or restaurants. You’re encouraged to fill out and regularly update the information for all the following sections:

Hotel Facilities – Research suggests that adding more hotel facilities information can increase your bookings by up to 10%!

Languages spoken – Let guests know which languages are spoken by the staff at your property. This is especially important for attracting travelers from other countries.

Sports and recreation – Guests love to know what activities they can enjoy while staying at your property.

Useful information – fill out other helpful information travelers usually look for.

Room level content refers to the features and offerings of your property that are **available in each room type**. Room facilities, size, view, and bed configuration are key content for each room type. Make sure to update the following information:

Room facilities – Let guests know all facilities provided in the room.

Room details – Guests want to know more about each room type.

Photos are crucial to your content score, but more importantly they matter to travelers when they’re browsing which hotels to book. You will need:

Your child policy can add a competitive advantage to your property. It lets guests know who is allowed at your property, and determines which rooms and properties will be shown on the search page when family travelers search for rooms. If your child policy is inaccurately set, potential guests may not even see your rooms or property at all.

Your Content Score is displayed on your **Production Report**. There, you can see your current content performance and the breakdown of what categories of content should be added to improve the Content Score.

To view your Content Score report…

For more information about the Content Score and how to update each content elements, please refer to the **Content Score Guideline**.


If you have difficulties accessing your Content Score report on the mobile application, please contact your market manager and inform them about the issue, or contact the support team via the support button on the YCS website.

This chart will explain the different ways the guest may reach out to you for any inquiries.

Agoda Customer Messaging System is a messaging platform that enables you to interact with guests. Enabling this service will allow guests to send a message to you before or after making a booking. You can check the messages both in YCS or in your registered email.

To enable this setting, please contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support widget in YCS.

**Guest messages before booking**


Guest will able to see the below pop-up on the property page on Agoda.com, inviting them to connect to the property if they have any inquiries before making a booking.

Inquiries submitted by guests before making any booking will be sent directly to the email address registered on YCS. The email address of the guest will be masked using this system. You may reply to the email as with any other email.


**Guest messages after booking**


Guests will have an inbox section on their Agoda profile through which they can chat with the property. Any message from the booked guest will be visible on the messaging system, if you follow the steps detailed in this article: __How can I check and send a message to a customer?__

You will also receive an email notification at your registered email address on YCS. You can simply reply to the email.


If you haven’t replied within 16 hours, there will be an email reminder sent to you.

** **

We will share your property’s contact information with the guest once they have successfully made a booking. This will include a phone number and email address (if available, based on your registered property information on Agoda). If they contact you, then you are free to reply.


**Sample guest hotel voucher contact information:**


Guests may reach out to Agoda’s customer service team for any inquiry related to bookings or special requests. Agoda’s customer service team may contact you for further follow-up via phone or email.


If you don’t have the Agoda messaging system activated yet, you may also reach out to Agoda customer service to relay your message to the guest via email or phone on your behalf. You can find our contact information on the hotel confirmation voucher’s bottom-most section.


Due to compliance with the Data Protection Act, we are unable to directly share the guest’s information with properties. Instead, we have prepared a safe platform where you may connect with the guest using the Agoda Customer Messaging system. If this is not yet enabled, you may reach out to Agoda Accommodation Support team to enable it.

The Agoda Customer Messaging system does not allow any card/personal information details to be shared, for security reasons. If you need the guest to contact you directly, you may instruct them to use the phone number listed on their booking confirmation voucher. If your phone number or email address needs to be updated, kindly update it on YCS contact first, and then contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support widget in YCS for updating it in the voucher.

You may reach out to the Agoda customer service team to forward your message to the guest. This will also depend on the guest’s responsiveness to our emails and calls.

On your property page, **automatically generated** content is displayed based on the property's **geographic location** (e.g.** GPS coordinates**)**. **

Photos of nearby attractions will display on the property page if your property is within a 10km radius.



**Popular landmarks/Nearby landmarks**

Our system selects the 10 nearest landmarks based on the location of your property for Nearby landmarks and the top 10 landmarks based on the priorities of our database for Popular landmarks.

Nearest essentials are generated by the system based on distance and cannot be changed.

** **

Nearby restaurants are displayed depending on the property and the restaurant's coordinates.



Unfortunately, we cannot. Time and distance are estimated or generated by the system and cannot be changed.

Photos can only be changed if it has been proven the attraction is not within a 10km radius of the property. You can send a request to the Agoda accommodation support team via the Support button in YCS.

As the nearest landmarks and essentials are generated by the system based on the distance, we are generally unable to update them. However, we can add new landmarks and essentials if they don't exist in our database. Once added, the system will regenerate the content. We can remove the landmarks displayed here only if they’re permanently closed.** You can send a request to the Agoda accommodation support team via the Support button in YCS.**

# Which photos do I need for my property?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052844793-Which-photos-do-I-need-for-my-property

Updated: 2021-04-08T19:57:58Z

**Overview**
**In this article, you will learn about the importance of photos and what photos are needed to create an attractive and outstanding property page. **
**Contents**
This article includes:
|

#

**Why photos are important for travelers**

A picture is worth a thousand words, and this is even more true in travel. Travelers use photos to select their destinations, so of course they also rely on photos to choose a hotel room or vacation home. Photos play an important role in creating an attractive and credible property page. Research shows that travelers make up to 60% of their decisions based on photos when browsing which hotels to book. *

Here’s why else you need a high-quality and complete set of photos for your property:

-
**Instantly grab traveler’s attention**. Photos are the most effective way to communicate what your property has to offer to guests in the shortest possible time.
-
**Create a first impression** **that sets you apart** from competitors in your area, making it easier for travelers to remember and choose your property over them.
-
**Increase the likelihood of bookings**. Up to 8x increase in bookings can be gained just from adding more photos! **

**Which photos do I need for my property?**

You should have photos that showcase the facilities, services, and all room types offered on Agoda. We recommend you have both property-level photos and room-level photos.

**Property-level photos**

Property-level photos are photos of the exterior or interior views of your hotel and its facilities. Guests expect to see a realistic representation of your hotel and its location as well as the amenities and services available for them once arrived. These photos also provide the traveler with a sense of “virtual arrival” as they imagine their vacation or business trip.

We recommend a **minimum** of 24 photos, but higher number of photos are highly recommended. The minimum should include at least…

- x2 photos of the property exterior

- x2 photos of the lobby or entrance


Photos of key facilities should include:

-
**Dining facilities** such as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, or other venues for food and beverages.

-
**Recreational facilities** such as lounge/shared area, kids/family area, shops, gardens, or other appealing and relaxing parts of the property.

-
**Pool facilities** such as poolside bar, kids pool, outdoor and indoor pool.

-
**Wellness facilities** such as spa and massage, sauna, steam room, hot tub, or fitness center.

-
**Sports and outdoors facilities** such as a beach, bicycle rentals, tennis court, squash court, children’s playroom, water activities, golf course, parks, or hiking.


**Tips on taking facilities photos**

- Take outdoor shots during golden hour for a magical quality of light, using shadows and contrasts to enhance the architecture of the building.
- Take photos of the property’s exterior and surrounding in wide shots to capture the whole environment of your property’s location.
- Interior shots should be taken during the day with as much natural light as possible to achieve soft and bright images.
- Show off your best areas – well-designed lobbies and community areas with distinct or local décor are a major attraction. Remember, guests will want to post pictures of themselves on social media, so these backdrops are important.
- Dining is key for many travelers. In addition to pictures of bars or restaurants, you may want to include shots of your most picturesque dishes or cocktails. Images of wine cellars, buffets, fresh seafood, or colorful fruit can have wide appeal.
- Show off all your facilities and highlight ones that other hotels might not have. A single facility can make the difference when travelers are making a final decision.


**Room-level photos**

Room-level photos should capture the room space and its features in a variety of angles to give guests a complete sense of the room’s size, facilities, and view.

We recommend photographing all room types available at your property with 4-6 photos for each room type. For each room type, it should consist of a **minimum** of…

- x3 photos showcasing the whole room space

Photos of **room features** could include:

- Bed
- View
- Mini bar
- Balcony or terrace
- Seating areas
- Coffee or tea facilities
- Room decoration

Photos of **bathrooms facilities** could include:

- Bathtub
- Bathrobe
- Hair dryer
- Complimentary toiletries

**Tips on taking room-level photos**

- Rooms must be clean, bright and clutter-free before taking any photos. Small details do matter such as wrinkle-free sheets, spotless mirrors, tidy surfaces, emptied trash.
- Make sure room is well-lit. Natural lighting during early morning or late afternoon is most ideal when taking room photos. Keep blinds and curtains open and lights on to help further brighten up the room.
- Take shots from all four corners to paint a better idea of the entire room layout for guests.

**Importance of Main photos**

First impressions matter, especially the first image a traveler sees of your hotel! The main photo is often the key factor that determines whether travelers will click on your property page on the search page. So it’s very important to carefully choose the main photo that best sells your property’s unique selling points.

**What main photos do I need?**

You need 2 types of main photos…

-
**Property main photo: **could be an exterior shot, exceptional interior shot such as a unique key facility.

-
**Room main photo: **For each room type, room main photo is needed. Select photos that show the bedroom from its best angle, giving guests a spacious sense of the entire room and a clear idea of the bed area.

- Decide on pending bookings ownership
- All bookings should be honored by the new/old management as all Agoda bookings are instantly confirmed.

To perform the above-required actions upon transfer of ownership that requires you to reach out to Agoda, see below-supporting documents or information our team will need to process your request:


**I am from the New Management**

- We will require you to send us a copy of the ownership transfer agreement before we are able to update the information for you.
- Written confirmation from the previous management is required to confirm that all pending bookings and payment issues have been cleared.
- Review the property payment method and inform us should any change of payment method, bank account update, or access be required.

- We will require you to inform the new management to contact us for further YCS information updates.
- You will be responsible to clear any outstanding payment before transferring the property to your partner unless otherwise stated in the agreement with the new management/owner.
- You will be responsible to ensure that all future Agoda bookings are honored by the new management.
- If the new management does not agree to extend the partnership with Agoda, inform Agoda so that we can process the termination of the contract.


**Frequently Asked Questions**

**There are future bookings, but the new management can’t honor these bookings. Can I cancel the bookings?**

Please be informed that rejecting any booking will create a bad experience for the customer and might harm both the property and Agoda’s reputation. We highly recommend you honor the booking.

However, in the case the booking cannot be accommodated, please be informed that you will be responsible for all the costs that your guest might incur due to a booking rejection. Find more details on the booking rejection cost here.

# How to get more guest reviews?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054384594-How-to-get-more-guest-reviews

Updated: 2021-04-25T20:08:50Z

#
**Overview**
**In this article, we’ll offer you some helpful information on why guest reviews are so important to your success, as well as offer you our best tips on how to improve both the quantity and quality of your reviews. **
#
** Contents**
This article includes:
|


**Why reviews matter?**

Reviews matter a lot because they’re the only independent source of information that a traveler can see when evaluating your property on Agoda. Smart travelers know that every property will present itself in the best way possible, with the most positive descriptions and flattering photos. They want information verified by an actual guest before believing it.

All guest reviews on Agoda are verified to be from actual guests who have stayed at your property and moderated to only include constructive information. That makes Agoda reviews a truly reliable source of feedback for both you and for future customers.

** **

**Importance of reviews to travelers **

Research shows that 96% of travelers consider reviews important when booking hotels. Additionally, about 79% of them will read between 6 and 12 reviews before making a purchase decision. That means that your guest reviews are often the most significant source of data that determines whether you get a booking or not. In fact, 93% of consumers say online reviews impact their purchasing decisions. Simply put, travelers trust verified reviews more than any other information.


**Importance of reviews to property owner**

As a property owner or manager, you have to constantly decide where to invest your resources in improving your hotel’s facilities, amenities, and services. Guest reviews provide updated and specific feedback on what impressed and disappointed your most recent customers. The more reviews you get, the more data you have on what your target demographic wants in accommodation.


**Why the number of reviews matter?**

Having lots of reviews help attract more bookings, by letting travelers know that you deserve your reputation. If you only have a few reviews, your review score won’t have the credibility you need to assure travelers that your property is as good as its score. **The more review you have, the more you’ll be perceived as a solid and reliable name that’s served many satisfied customers. **

We’ve gathered some tips below to help you get more reviews as fast as possible.


**How to get more guest reviews on Agoda?**

-
**Give your guests something positive to talk about **
- Research shows that up to 89% of travelers are willing to post about a positive travel experience. Always ensure the best service, amenities, and features that will make the guest experience worth talking about. Aim for the unique and unexpected, as these will stand out in a guest’s memory.

-
**Offer a welcoming gift with a personal note **
- One easy way to encourage reviews is to leave a personal note with a welcoming gift wishing your guest a great stay, while gently reminding them to please review their experience on Agoda. By connecting the gift with the review, you’ll create the positive association that you want. Personal communication makes guests feel special, especially if it is written by hand or includes their name.

-
**Leave visual reminders**
- You can even place physical reminders like stickers or flyers around your property to remind guests to review their stay. The repetition of seeing the message repeated in many places can unconsciously plant the idea of writing a review into their minds.

-
**Remind guests at check-out **
- Make a good final impression during check-out by giving your guests a complimentary gift, like a set of postcards, with a friendly message that your hotel would greatly appreciate a review from them. You can even remind them specifically that Agoda will be sending them an email with an easy one-click link to help them write a review without hassle.


*Agoda Reviews email that will be sent out to guests after they check out. *

-
**Ask face-to-face during check-out **
- It’s quite common for staff to ask guests how they enjoyed their stay as they are checking out. Why not train your staff to mention that guests can easily leave review through the email Agoda will send? In fact, 77% of customers say they would be willing to leave a review if asked. So ask!

-
**Explain how valuable their feedback is to you **
- Everyone wants to feel important. Let guests know that feedback is valuable, both to you and to future travelers. Inform them that written reviews are carefully read by management, and that improvements are based on that feedback. Ask then if they intend to come again, and if they say yes, ask them to write a review “so that we know what to improve for your next stay.”

# How review scores work?

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054389534-How-review-scores-work

Updated: 2021-09-20T06:55:28Z

#
**Overview**
**In this article, you’ll learn the basics of a property’s Review Score and why it’s so important to getting bookings. You’ll also learn how to get the most and best Review Score for your property. **
#
** Contents**
This article includes:
|


**What is a Review Score?**

Your Review Score is the aggregate rating that your property earns based on all the reviews that are left by your Agoda guests. We only allow real guests to review your property after check-out, so that your review score represents an honest and true evaluation of your property’s strengths and weaknesses. Travelers rely on these Review Scores to help make their booking decisions because they trust other travelers, which is why Review Scores are one of the most important factors in getting bookings.

After your guests check out, we send them an email inviting them to submit a written review, as well as to grade your property on the factors listed below.


**Review Score Criteria**

Your overall Review Score is calculated from the 5 following categories:

-
**Value for money**
-
**Service**
-
**Facilities**
-
**Location**
-
**Cleanliness**

Guests will rate your property for the above categories on a scale of 1 to 5. We then calculate the average of these overall scores on a 1-10 score and display it as the **Overall Review Rating** on your property page. This score will also show up in search results.


**Tips for boosting your Review Score**

**Meeting (and exceeding) guests’ expectations **

- Accuracy matters -- what you offer on your Agoda listing should exactly match with what you’re going to provide.
- This includes all content data such as facilities, amenities, and photos. Be honest at all times, because dishonesty or even the perception of it will lead to bad reviews.
- When it comes to service, try to exceed expectations. Guests will frequently compliment service that goes out of its way to do the unexpected.

**Update your property page regularly **

- By keeping your information updated, you can manage guest expectations ahead of their stay and increase customer satisfaction.
- Regularly check the information you provide on YCS. Does it list all your facilities and include updated photos of your property? Are your hotel details up to date? Have you made any improvements or changes in décor that should be shown?

**Learn from your current review score **

- Look at your current Review Score, and focus on improving the category where you received the lowest score.
- Read your existing reviews to see specifics of what guests like, and what they complain about.
- For example, if you receive a low Cleanliness rating on your Review Score, and you were able to identify that many guests mention dirty linens, it may be time to replace your bedding, audit your laundry service, or work with housekeeping to ensure all linens are fresher.

**Optimize service**

- The fastest way to boost your Review Score is to provide excellent service every day, to every guest.
- Train your staff to be attentive, responsive, and have a sense of urgency for every guest’s needs.
- Recognize and reward employees who have gone above and beyond for guests, in order to motivate other staff members.
- Staff should always be able to offer a local knowledge of things to do and places to eat. Responsive helpfulness is always memorable to travelers.

**Cleanliness is more important than ever**

- Ensure your property is well maintained and everything works as it should. Make sure that your staff has the capacity and training to address problems right away, such as minor maintenance problems, water leaks, or loud noises. Guests like a well-run property.
- Rooms should always be spotless and comfortable, with no clutter.
- Establish a hygiene protocol that is strictly enforced in ways that guests can see. It’s a good idea to make your cleanliness processes public – show them on signage or on a letter to guests in every room.

**Overview**
**This article provides a handy guide to helping you take the best and most attractive photos of your property. Remember, research shows that photos are one of the single most influential pieces of content when it comes to travelers deciding where to book. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then having great pictures of your property and rooms is surely worth a thousand bookings!**

When travelers dream of new journeys, they look at online photos of places to go. Humans are visually stimulated – we use pictures to help us select everything we buy, eat, and do. Your presentation of your property and its rooms on Agoda is more than just a catalog – they entice our millions of daily visitors to integrate your place into their travel dreams. It’s important that you offer thorough, inviting, and accurate photos of what your property offers.


**Get your property photo-ready**

When preparing your hotel for a photo shoot, go a step further than your usual standard in your cleaning routine. The camera will pick up even the slightest detail, so make sure everything is spotless. Arrange every item of furniture and even small objects in their optimal place. See below for specific tips for each room.



**Preparing a guest room**

- Clean, steam, or press linens and fluff pillows
- Steam curtains and keep them open for natural light and view
- Close sheer curtains to create a soft diffuse light, or open sheer curtains if the view is more interesting
- Leave out unsightly objects like air vents or trash cans
- Make sure windows, mirrors, and floors are spotless
- Turn off the TV and hide any wires or cables


**Preparing a bathroom**

- Always lower toilet seats
- A full roll of toilet paper makes it seem like it was recently cleaned
- Make sure sinks, showers and baths are not wet
- Open shower curtains if possible so travelers can get the full picture
- Towels that are hanging or folded should be of equal lengths
- Empty the trash bins
- Arrange complimentary toiletries in a prominent place so they stand out


**Preparing a dining area in a restaurant**

- Choose food and drinks to be featured in the shoot such as signature dish or drinks
- Food and drinks with a pop of color and creative presentation will look best in photos
- Try to use food that is representative of the restaurant’s signature cuisine

- Set tables and chairs in proper order
- For formal settings, aim for orderliness and perfection
- For casual settings aim for inviting appearance and comfort


**Preparing property facilities**

- Communicate with housekeeping to do a final check before the shoot
- Remove any unnecessary objects like newspaper and magazines
- Make sure all areas are free of guests’ belongings
- Plan your shoot during off-peak hours or when facilities are closed
- Inform guests in advance that a photoshoot will be taking place as certain facilities, such as the gym, pool, or spa, may need to be closed for guests in order to be photographed properly.


**What to avoid when taking photos?**

- Road signs or parked cars
- People or animals
- Other companies’ logos
- Seasonal decorations
- Unsightly objects such as dirty/messy facilities
- Poorly lit scenes
- Identical images were taken at a different angle
- Misleading images of area landmarks or views that you cannot see from the property


**Shooting tips**

-
**Use a tripod **for steady, balanced photos. Tripods prevent motion blur while allowing you maximum freedom to make adjustments to composition. You can set your frame, and then make adjustments or furnishings, lighting, or object arrangement without losing your original composition.
-
**Get the lighting right. **Natural light is usually the best, but depending on how much natural light you can get in a room or space, you may need to supplement with indoor lighting. Experiment with different lighting combinations in the same composition to find the ideal solution. Play around with how lights hit in the space and don’t be afraid to take a lot of shots to compare. Curtains and blinds should always be open, but sheer curtains can be closed if they create a soft diffuse light, and if the view out the windows does not add value.
-
**The composition is key **to create depth and dynamism in your photos. Shooting from corners makes rooms look larger, and helps a viewer take in the entire space. If you are shooting directly into space from one side, try and make the horizontal lines perfectly flat, top creates a sense of foundation and evenness.
-
**Use the widest setting on your lens** to capture more room space in the shot, making rooms and open spaces appear wider and more generous.
-
**Mix up your shots. **Not only a wide variety of shots but also a wide variety of styles will make your property seem like a dynamic and diverse place. For example, classic wide-angle or panoramic shots set the scene and enable guests to imagine themselves within the hotel. By pairing these with close-ups that feature special amenities and decoration details, the total effect evokes a feeling or mood and completes the experience in the mind of the traveler.

** **

**Technical requirements**

Your photos need to be high-quality to be effectively displayed on different digital platforms. We recommend that all photos:

- Meet a minimum resolution of 800 x 600 pixels -- higher resolution is better
- Are in JPG/JPEG format only
- Use landscape orientation only, as they will look better on your property page.
- Are in color with natural tone
- Come in an original size less than 10MB each

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059929113-What-are-the-facilities-most-guests-look-for-nowadays

Updated: 2021-08-09T16:11:13Z

**Overview**
**This article provides an overview of what facilities are most important to those booking on Agoda today. By learning the priorities of current travelers, you can design or improve your property to meet these needs and attract more bookings. **
**Content **
This article includes
|


**The facilities most guests look for**

**With millions of daily travelers visiting and booking on Agoda’s website and app, we’ve acquired a huge amount of data that can tell us a lot about what kinds of properties get booked the most. **

**According to our data, the most important facilities to offer to travelers are the following. Make sure that your property offers all or most of them! **


**Fast & free Wi-Fi access **

Whether on a business trip or on vacation, wi-fi that works is the by far the most important thing to the greatest number of modern travelers. Staying connected with loved ones, uploading and downloading work, and accessing social media and news is so important that poor Wi-Fi is one of the biggest causes of negative reviews. Travelers also use the internet to research their next day trip or meal while traveling.

- Wi-Fi should be fast and able to work perfectly even at maximum hotel capacity when almost every single guest is connected to the network. Your system needs to scale to handle full capacity or more – such as when you have events with guests who may not even be staying in your rooms.
- The signal must be strong in all public areas, as well as in all rooms, whether they are located on the ground floor or on the top floor of the hotel. Travelers now use social media networks for video calls and phone calls, and might be moving around your property while doing so. A dropped signal or call at an important time creates a very bad guest experience.
- Wi-Fi should be free to those who eat in your restaurants as well, even if they are staying in rooms.


**Free breakfast **

Breakfast is not only the most important meal of the day, but it is also one the most important services for guests when staying at a hotel because it saves them time and effort on their precious travel days.

Consider offering a complimentary breakfast for your guests, and make it as tasty and varied as possible. Even if you have to raise your room prices slightly to cover your costs, the perceived value of a free breakfast is usually greater than that of a slightly cheaper room.


**Wellness facilities **

Wellness travel, or travel associated with the pursuit of maintaining or enhancing one’s personal well-being, is a fast-growing segment that creates $639 billion for the tourism industry.*** **

As more consumers adopt wellness as part of their value system, they will increasingly filter their travel experiences through a holistic wellness lens. While traveling, they want to relax, but also to be able to maintain their daily routines, which may require certain facilities:

-
**Workout** facilities such as a pool or fitness center.
-
**Relaxation and beauty** facilities such as massage, spa, salon, or sauna.
-
**Mind and body** facilities such as yoga room or a space for quiet meditation.
-
**Healthy eating** food options such as vegan, gluten-free, low-sugar, or plant-based.
-
**Eco and adventure** activities such as surfing lessons, canoeing, skiing, hiking, or other activities that engage the local environment.

To help you promote your offerings, key wellness activities that you offer will be prominently displayed under your property name on the Agoda property page.

**Global Wellness Tourism Economy research by the Global Wellness Institute*


**Smart entertainment devices **

-
**Smart TV**: Netflix and other digital platforms have become a daily habit for a big part of the world, especially for millennials. Allowing guests to connect their devices and watch the rest of the movie they began watching during their flight or catch the latest episode from their favorite series is a plus. Make sure your TVs have either built-in apps like Netflix, or HDMI and USB ports that allow guests to play their own content from their laptops or USB drives.
-
**Bluetooth speakers** that allow guests to connect to their playlist from smartphones using iTunes or Spotify or other music services. By allowing guests to create their own musical ambience, they can customize their stay. Make sure that your Wi-Fi can handle many guests at once using music streaming services!


**In-room food and beverages**

-
**Coffee/Tea maker**: Offer your guests a cup of quality coffee from the comfort of their room to start their day, without having to order it via room service. For a truly boutique touch, a sleek capsule espresso machine adds a quality impression, with a certain number of free capsules provided per day. A lower cost option is to offer a drip coffee machine, or just hot water makers that can be poured over one-serving coffee drip packets. Whatever you do, don’t offer only instant coffee packets. For most coffee drinkers, instant coffee is so unpalatable that they would rather have nothing at all.


**Cleanliness facilities **

Prioritizing cleanliness has become the “new normal” way of travel for everyone due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Guests want to know about the cleanliness measures you take before booking your property.

To improve guest confidence in your property when booking, you should provide cleanliness and hygiene facilities at your hotels that can be displayed prominently in your property content.

# VAT Implication for Thailand Properties

Source: https://agodapropertypartnerhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401847395091-VAT-Implication-for-Thailand-Properties

The Act Amending the Revenue Code No. 53 B.E. 2564 (2021) (“e-Service Tax Law”) regarding value added tax (“VAT”) collection by foreign electronic service providers who provide services to non-VAT registrants in Thailand was published in the Royal Gazette on the 10th February 2021, to take effect starting 1st September 2021.

As a company registered in Singapore providing electronic service to Thai consumers, Agoda is required to register under the e-Service Tax Law. Under the Act, Agoda is required to remit 7% VAT on amounts earned from Thai consumers to the Thai Revenue Department.

“Thai consumer” refers to a “service recipient who is non-VAT registered in Thailand”.

Under the VAT Act:

Three options are available for you to add your VAT ID:

**Option 1. Simply put in the VAT ID through YCS Pop -up**. On Tuesday 25th May 2021, YCS Pop up V.2 was launched with the ability to let you submit your VAT ID in the correct 13 digit format.


You can update your VAT ID at any time in YCS Setting --> Property Settings --> Property Information --> Additional regional settings --> Click save.




**Option 2. Go to the Property settings page: Additional setting section**


**Option 3. You can also add the VAT-ID details from the following Google form: ****click here**


**Hotels,** can ask questions by clicking

<<https://ycs.agoda.com/en-us/kipp/public/home>> in our extranet. Hotels can search also for **payment** and select --> **I have a question about Taxes, Fees or Surcharges.**

**For Home (non-hotel) properties**, just click the Contact us button


**Can I use Google Forms to add the VAT ID?**

**Answer**: Yes, just click here


**How can I send a bulk request to add VAT ID details for multiple properties?**

**Answer**: If you have more than 1 property for which you want to provide a 13 digit VAT ID, you can upload an excel file with the requested data in the same format as the sample excel file below (click Add file) via the Google form.


--- FILE: 1a26897536dae5a0.md ---
Your exact map location is available to confirmed guests, but what about potential guests in public search? You can choose how your location is shown by enabling/disabling Show your specific location. If you enable this option, your listing will show a small circle with greater accuracy, but not the exact point.

**Note:** For hosts in the Airbnb-friendly program who enable this option, your listing will display a small circle with greater accuracy. It will also allow Airbnb or your building to promote your listing, which may associate your listing with your building’s name and address. For example, your listing may be featured on your building’s Airbnb-friendly details page.

--- FILE: 2a35d1e4f281394b.md ---
You can only edit your listing address before you accept your first booking. Once guests have stayed there, or if you have an upcoming reservation, you’ll need to contact us to change it. If you’ve moved or you’re listing a new place, you’ll need to create a new Airbnb listing.

You can also customize how your listing is shown on the map to be more general or specific in public search results. But for safety and convenience, always provide confirmed guests with your listing’s exact address and map location.

If your listings are in **Japan**, **Malaysia**, **Vietnam**, **Thailand**, **Indonesia**, **or the Philippines**, our system may automatically check your listing address for missing information. We’ll reach out via email or notification if your listing needs to be updated.

If your listing has upcoming reservations, we’ll make sure to let your guests know about any address changes. We still recommend reaching out to guests directly with any additional directions or specific instructions for finding your place.

To add missing address details:

If a host has to cancel a booking due to a valid reason that makes hosting impossible—like a personal illness or major property damage—we’ll waive cancellation fees or other consequences.

If a home, service, or experience host has to cancel a reservation, they may be subject to fees and other consequences as outlined in the Host Cancellation Policy for homes and the Host Cancellation Policy for services and experiences.

It’s important to know that hosts should never cancel for any reason that violates our policies, including our Nondiscrimination Policy and Accessibility Policy.

Valid cancellation reasons include, but aren’t limited to:

Valid cancellation reasons include, but aren’t limited to:

If a home host uses Instant Book, they may be able to cancel for additional valid reasons without consequences under certain circumstances. Some examples include:

Hosts may be able to cancel Instant Book reservations online for these reasons in most cases, but sometimes they may have to contact us to cancel without consequences. Otherwise, fees and consequences will apply. If a host cancels a large number of Instant Book reservations, they may be required to turn off Instant Book.

To cancel without consequences, or have consequences waived in one of these situations, a host may be required to submit proof of documentation. For example, they might be asked to provide photos, videos, and other documentation in the case of emergency repairs, or a letter from a doctor in the case of serious personal illness.

If a host can’t honor a reservation—regardless of the reason—it’s their responsibility to cancel in a timely manner to allow their guest time to adjust their plans. If the check-in time is within 24 hours, the option to cancel online won’t be available—the host will need to contact us.

If a problem stems from an API software provider and the host needs to cancel a reservation as a result, the host must provide evidence of the API software provider’s outage or incident for consideration when requesting a fees and consequences waiver.

If you’re not sure if your situation qualifies, contact us before you cancel. Learn more about our cancellation fees for home hosts or service or experience host cancellation fees.

As a host, you’re always in charge of your prices. You can change it at any time—you’re in control.

You can set your nightly price when you create your listing in your Airbnb setup. The price you set applies to all future nights, and you can edit your nightly price any time in your Calendar through **Pricing**.

You can also set a custom nightly price for any night by selecting and editing the night in your calendar.

Your nightly price includes the price you set per night at your home and base price for accommodations. The base price is your payout, which includes any additional fees that you charge and excludes the host service fee.

Your nightly price will also include applicable taxes in countries with existing price display requirements. Check out your nightly price breakdown.

# Updating your availability

*Updated Jul 14, 2025*

Airbnb’s availability settings make it easy to control when and how guests book your place. You’ll find them in your calendar.

Pricing tools and availability settings often work together. For example, if you offer an early bird discount, allowing guests to book 12 or 24 months in advance can help you reach more guests who plan ahead.

## Adjusting your trip length

Changing your trip length can open your calendar and help your listing appear in more search results. Just make sure your minimum and maximum trip lengths follow local rules and regulations.

**Minimum nights:**Lowering your minimum trip length appeals to guests booking short stays and helps fill gaps in your calendar. You can set a minimum night stay based on the day of check-in.**Maximum nights:**Increasing your maximum trip length helps attract guests booking longer stays, which reduces turnovers. You can also allow requests for stays that are longer than your maximum. You’ll be able to review and approve these requests.**Custom trip length:**Adding a custom trip length that’s shorter than your minimum trip length for certain dates can help you fill gaps in your calendar.

Nights will automatically be available based on your settings. If your settings are blocking dates, you’ll find tips to unblock them. For example, if your minimum length of stay is 5 nights and you have 4 unbooked nights between reservations, you’ll see a tip to lower your trip minimum for those nights.

## Managing your availability

Decide how much notice you need before guests arrive and how far in advance people can book.

**Advance notice:**Decide how much time you need between a guest’s booking and their arrival. You can select the same day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 7 days. Even if you choose 1 day or more, you can allow requests with less than a day’s notice, which you’ll need to review and approve.**Same-day notice:**If you allow guests to book on the same day as check-in, you set the cut-off time after which they can no longer book. Select any hour between 6:00 AM and 12:00 AM.**Preparation time:**Choose how many nights you need to block off before and after each reservation. The options are none, 1 night before and after each reservation, or 2 nights before and after each reservation.**Availability window:**Extending how far in advance guests can book helps your listing appear in more search results. Select 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 months ahead.**More availability settings:**You can restrict guests from checking in or out on certain days of the week. This blocks your calendar from arrivals or departures if you know you’re unavailable on certain days. You can select up to 6 days per week.

## Connecting your calendars

If you use multiple calendars, syncing all your hosting calendars helps prevent double bookings. This 2-way connection automatically updates both calendars when a night is booked. To connect your calendars:

- Add the provided Airbnb calendar link to the other website.
- Get a link ending in .ics from the other website and add it to your Airbnb calendar.

*You control your pricing and other settings at all times. Your results may vary.*

Sharing your space can bring you lasting memories, worldwide connections, and cash in your pocket—but it all begins with pricing.

Your calendar will display your default nightly price on all dates you haven’t customized. You can customize your prices for any nights you choose, such as high-demand dates like holidays or special events. Just know that any pricing changes you make will only apply to future reservations, not those that are already pending or confirmed.

If you want your price to change based on demand, turn on **Smart Pricing**. Otherwise:

Your new custom price will show for each selected night, overriding your default nightly price as well as any Smart Pricing, weekend pricing, or long-term pricing you may have set.

Price tips are personalized recommendations based on factors like your listing’s location and amenities, your past bookings, and the latest prices in your area.

To view price tips go to your calendar and click or tap **Price tips **.

Here’s the good news: Your money is coming! The timing of your payout depends on the type of reservation, the length of your guest’s stay for a home reservation, your payout schedule and your payout method’s processing time, and whether you’re a new host. You can always check the status of your payout in your earnings dashboard.

Co-host payouts for home reservations are usually released at the same time as host payouts, and the info in this article also applies to them.

After Airbnb releases your payout, there’s a processing time before the money arrives with your payment provider. Processing times may vary by payment method provider and region. Here are typical processing timeframes for common payout methods:

Be sure to set up at least one payout method so you can get paid. If you want your payouts to be released automatically, be sure to set a default payout method.

You can always check the status of your payout in your earnings dashboard.

If you have multiple listings with check-ins on the same day, your money will usually be sent as a single payout. If you have a minimum payout amount set, your payout won’t be sent until that amount is met.

Banking systems don’t process transactions on weekends or holidays, so your money will be processed the next business day. Contact your bank directly if you have any questions.

Fast Pay and Payoneer allow payouts to be processed and sent on weekends and holidays.

All transactions may be reviewed before they’re sent. For example, we may review a transaction in order to prevent fraud. This could result in funds being delayed up to 45 days after guest check-in, paused, or, in rare cases, removed from your account. In these cases, we may be required to limit account permissions and payment transfers, and you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity. You can check the status of your payouts in your earnings dashboard.

Reviews are part of standard processes that many companies like Airbnb conduct in order to prevent fraud and comply with regulations.

In some cases, the financial institution or payout method you use to get your money may charge additional fee(s). For more information, learn about calculating your payout.

Effective date: October 9, 2023

Although cancellations by hosts are rare, and some cancellations are beyond a host’s control, cancellations by hosts can disrupt guest plans and undermine confidence in our community. For those reasons, if the host cancels a confirmed reservation, or if the host is found to be responsible for a cancellation under this Policy, Airbnb may impose fees and other consequences. The fees and other consequences set out in this Policy are intended to reflect the costs and other impacts of these cancellations on guests, the broader host community, and Airbnb. We will waive the fees and, in some cases, the other consequences, if the host cancels because of a Major Disruptive Event or certain valid reasons beyond the host’s control.

If a host cancels a confirmed reservation, or if the host is found to be responsible for a cancellation under this Policy, we will impose fees subject to a minimum cancellation fee of $50 USD. The fee is based on the reservation amount and when the reservation is canceled:

When calculating cancellation fees, the reservation amount includes the base rate, cleaning fee, and any pet fees, but excludes taxes and guest fees. If the calculated cancellation fee is less than $50 USD, it will be adjusted up to $50 USD.

Cancellation fees are typically withheld from the next payout(s) to the host as provided in the Payments Terms of Service. In addition to the fees and consequences set out in this Policy, hosts who cancel, or are found responsible for a cancellation, will not receive a payout for the canceled reservation, or, if the payout has already been made, then the amount of the payout will be withheld from the next payout(s).

We will waive the fees set out in this Policy in appropriate situations, for example if the host cancels because of a Major Disruptive Event or certain valid reasons beyond the host’s control. Hosts who believe one of these situations applies will be required to provide documentation or other support. We will determine whether to waive any fees and other consequences after evaluating the available evidence.

In the event a fee is waived, other consequences may still apply, like blocking a Listing’s calendar.

Regardless of whether we waive any fees or other consequences, the host will not receive a payout for the canceled reservation.

In addition to a cancellation fee, other consequences may apply, such as preventing the host from accepting another reservation for the Listing on the affected dates by blocking the Listing’s calendar.

Hosts who cancel confirmed bookings without a valid reason may experience other consequences, as explained in our Terms of Service and ground rules for hosts. For example, hosts may have their Listing or account suspended or removed, and may lose their Superhost status.

A host may be responsible for a cancellation when it occurs because of conditions in the Listing that are grossly and materially different from how the Listing was described at the time of booking. In these cases, the host will be subject to the fees and other consequences laid out in this Policy, regardless of who initiates the cancellation. Examples may include: double-booking a Listing, substituting another property for the Listing booked by the guest, or gross Listing inaccuracies that materially disrupt a guest stay, like advertising a pool when no pool is available for use by guests.

If a host cannot honor a reservation—regardless of the reason—it’s their responsibility to cancel in a timely manner to allow their guest time to adjust their plans. A host may not encourage the guest to cancel the reservation.

Providing false statements or materials in connection with this Policy violates our Terms of Service and may result in account termination and other consequences.

This Policy applies to cancellations that occur on or after the effective date. Any right that guests or hosts may have to initiate legal action remains unaffected. Any changes to this Policy will be made in accordance with our Terms of Service. This Policy applies to stays, but does not apply to experience reservations.

You can print payout details for individual reservations or export all payouts and transactions from a set period of time in a CSV file.

The CSV file can be opened by any standard spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, or Apple Numbers). This spreadsheet includes additional information, like transaction history, Host service fees or cleaning fee (if you charge one) as well as gross earnings and any taxes withheld for each earning.

The Earnings dashboard features an interactive performance chart—giving you access to your earnings through monthly and yearly views, plus filter by listing, and get more detail on prior years and future projections.

Your year-to-date summary is the total amount you've earned for each reservation that year. It also displays any service fees, taxes, or other deductions and your net total earnings.

You can filter upcoming transactions by date and listing, and search for specific transactions using the reservation confirmation code or payout amount.

Open a specific transaction to review transaction details, along with the date it is scheduled to be sent and how the payout was calculated. You can also change the payout method the transaction is going to by selecting **change your payout method**.

Find the last 3 paid transactions from the Earnings dashboard or click **Show all paid **to get a full list.

Select each row to review earnings details, including reservation information, adjustments, and cancellation details.

If you have multiple listings with reservations that start on the same day, earnings may be paid out together, which will be displayed in a single row.

If you owe a guest money for a cancellation or reservation change, you can track it in your Earnings dashboard. Learn more about what an adjustment on your earnings means.

When you get paid depends on the length of your guest’s stay, your payout method’s processing time, and whether or not you’re a new host. We'll update you when your payouts are sent. Learn more about when you’ll get your payout.

If you host on other websites, you can sync all of your hosting calendars to prevent multiple guests from booking the same dates. For example, when a night is booked on one calendar, it’ll automatically block on the other—keeping your schedule up-to-date and making hosting administration a little easier.

To export, we’ll give you a URL that you’ll paste into the other website’s calendar—this will send information from your Airbnb calendar to the other website (for example, VRBO or Booking.com), or you can export to a personal calendar (like Google or Apple).

Once you export, changes on your Airbnb calendar will be reflected automatically on the other website’s calendar, depending on their website settings.

To import, you’ll need to get a URL from the other website’s calendar and add it to Airbnb. On most websites, you can find this in a section dedicated to calendar importing and exporting. Tip: Make sure the URL ends in .ics, because other URLs won’t work.

Learn how to import a calendar from VRBO, Booking.com, and Tripadvisor.

Nights that you block—or that are booked on Airbnb—will be blocked on the other website’s calendar. Your Airbnb calendar will include nights that are blocked for your availability settings, preparation time, advance notice, and minimum stays.

Nights booked on another website’s calendar will be automatically blocked on Airbnb when you’ve connected them to your Airbnb calendar. However, nights that you block on another calendar may or may not be blocked on Airbnb—this can include preparation time or advance notice settings that you’ve set on other calendars.

Need more help? Check out other help centers on how to block a calendar from VRBO, Booking.com, and Tripadvisor.

Your Airbnb calendar automatically updates every 3 hours, and pulls in information from the other calendars you’ve connected. To check your latest availability sooner than 3 hours, you can go to your connected calendar and select **Refresh**.

If you’ve connected multiple calendars, they may automatically update at different times. We’ll show the latest time that each calendar was updated, and you can manually refresh them as well.

Note that we’re only able to request updates from the other website so many times—if you exceed that amount of updates, you’ll need to wait until the next automatic update.

We import up to 2 years of data. You can’t pause an imported calendar. You’d need to disconnect the calendar and reconnect it when you’re ready to sync your calendars again. To remove a synced calendar, click or tap **Edit** and then **Disconnect Calendar**.

Ready to host? Fantastic. Just set up a payout method and prepare to welcome your guests.

The first payout method you add is automatically set to be your default method. If you set up more than one payout method, you can choose a default.

In some countries, we'll confirm your account info by depositing a small amount (less than $1 USD) before sending you a payout. This usually happens when a new payout method is added.

When it’s ready, the earnings will be released to your payout method for processing. You can check the status of your earnings at any time from your earnings dashboard.

## FAQs

-
If your .ics link isn't working, here are a few steps to try:

- Double-check the link for accuracy.
- Ensure your third-party calendar supports .ics links.
- Wait a moment and try syncing again, as it can take up to two hours for updates to refresh.

-
No, we currently do not have a sync option for Google Calendar.

-
Calendars aren’t synced in real time and can take up to two hours to refresh, so individual bookings and reservations made on other platforms won’t sync immediately with your Booking.com calendar, and vice versa.

-
First, check your .ics link to make sure it’s formatted correctly. If the problem persists, try reconnecting. Also, check the connection settings on the other OTA.

-
Yes, just navigate to the

**Sync calendars**page, find the calendar you want to remove, click**Remove**, and confirm your choice. -
Even though the calendar sync updates your availability across platforms, it doesn’t happen in real time. This means reservations made on other platforms might not sync right away, which can lead to double bookings. While this is rare, if it does happen, contact our team for support.

# Setting reservation restrictions for your property

Have more control over your property by setting reservation restrictions. You can set multiple restrictions and conditions depending on the type of calendar you use – either list or monthly view. If some restrictions aren’t available for your property, contact us, and we’ll enable them for you.


Remember, the more restrictions you set, the fewer potential guests will see your property.

You can set up reservation restrictions using either the list view or the monthly view calendar on the **Extranet** or using the **Pulse app**. Click each of the tabs below to learn about the available options:


If you’re using the list view calendar, you can apply the following restrictions to your rooms or units and rates:

- Minimum and maximum length of stay – this is the minimum or maximum number of nights guests must book for
- Minimum and maximum length of stay from arrival – this is the minimum or maximum number of nights a guest must stay when arriving on a specific date
**Exact stay**– this refers to the exact number of nights guests have to stay at your property when arriving on a specific date- No arrivals and departures – this prevents guests from starting stays on days when you’re unable to check them in and ending stays on days when you can’t check them out
- Minimum and maximum advance reservation – this is the minimum or maximum amount of time before check-in that a guest can book your property

In list view, you can remove most restrictions by following the same steps you used to set them and setting the value to zero (0). For example, to remove a minimum length of stay restriction, set the minimum number of nights guests must book as zero. To remove restrictions for multiple dates, click a cell in the restriction row. Then drag the blue slider across all the dates you want to remove the restriction for, click**Remove** and then**Save**. To remove no arrivals and departures restrictions, click the cell in the calendar to remove the restriction on that date.


There are fewer restrictions available when using the monthly view calendar. You can apply the following:

- Minimum length of stay – this is the minimum number of nights guests must book for
- Minimum advance reservation – the minimum amount of time before check-in that a guest can book at your property
- No arrivals and departures – this prevents guests from starting stays on days when you’re unable to check them in and ending stays on days when you can’t check them out

To remove Minimum length of stay restrictions, set the value to one (1) night. To remove Minimum advance reservation restrictions, set the value to "None." For No arrivals and departures restrictions, click on the cell in the calendar to deselect and remove the restriction on that date. For each restriction, you need to click**Save** to apply the changes.


Follow these steps to set restrictions using the Pulse app:

- Log in to the Pulse app on your mobile device
- Go to the
**Availability**tab - If you have multiple properties, tap the property you want to edit
- If you’re viewing the dates in a list view, scroll down to the
**date and room type**you want to edit, then tap**Rates and restrictions** - If you’re viewing the dates in a calendar view, choose the
**room type**you want to manage, then select the**date** - Continue with the steps below to set restrictions for either one or multiple dates

Continue with these steps if you want to set restrictions for a **single date**:

- Tap the box next to
**Minimum length of stay**, then choose your preferred amount of nights - Next to
**Minimum advance reservation**, choose your preferred advance reservation time - Tap
**Save**on iOS or the**check mark**on Android

Continue with these steps if you want to set restrictions for **multiple dates**:

- Tap the start date and end date on the calendar to specify the date range you want to make changes to, then tap
**Rates and restrictions** - Tap the box next to
**Minimum length of stay**, then choose your preferred amount of nights - Next to
**Minimum advance reservation**, choose your preferred advance reservation time - Tap
**Save**on iOS or the**check mark**on Android

Note: If you have multiple rate plans, you should set up the same restrictions for all open rate plans and rooms or units. This way, you’ll make sure the restriction applies to all future bookings at your property.

For example, if you want to make the minimum length of stay two nights for a room with a standard rate plan, but you also have a non-refundable rate plan, **set the minimum length of stay as two nights for both**. Otherwise, you can still receive one-night reservations.

# Paying your invoices

We email our commission invoices to all partners the first week of every month. This invoice reflects the commission for all reservations completed during the previous month. Other than the commission invoice, you might also receive the following invoice types: customer complaint invoices, incorrect reporting invoices, debit notes, and credit notes. Additional invoices are issued throughout the month.

**In this article**

**Understanding your invoices**

Commission invoices are posted in the Extranet’s **Finance **menu on the **Invoices** page. They’re also emailed to the address found in **Account settings**.

Your property is invoiced for all reservations completed in the previous month. If a guest doesn’t show up for their booking, you have 48 hours after check-out to mark them as a no-show to avoid being invoiced for the booking. Read more about what reservations are included in your invoices.

Note: Partners from certain areas might receive invoices for VAT/GST in a separate document.

Additional invoices are posted on the Extranet via **Invoices** under the **Finance **menu, and are issued throughout the month. We recommend you check the **Invoices** page at least every two weeks.

Learn more about invoices with multiple currencies and additional invoices.

**Paying your invoices**

Paying your invoice can differ based on your selected payment method on the Extranet. The three main ways of paying invoices are:

- Direct debit – payment will be directly debited from the account you provided in
**Bank details**, under the**Finance**menu**.**Invoices will be marked as paid on the day we send the payment request to your bank. If the direct debit fails, the invoice will appear overdue. The invoice will then have to be paid via bank transfer. You can find our bank details by following these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to the
**Finance**menu - Select the
**Financial overview**option, then**Payment information**

To check why the payment failed, contact your bank.

- Bank transfer – our bank details are included in the invoice, under the due date. Don’t forget to include your property ID and invoice number
as the payment reference – they’re necessary for us to identify your payment and process it correctly. - Online payment or payment option through a payment service provider (PSP) – this is available for some partners depending on location. If this method is available for you, you’ll need to follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet and go to the
**Finance**menu - Select the invoice you want to pay under
**Invoices** - Click the button available for the selected invoice

If you’re both based and operating in Brazil, there are two additional ways of paying your invoices:

- Boleto – you can pay your invoice through this bank document with a barcode. Go to
**Invoices**under the**Finance**menu and find the document that says**Commission**. Underneath, you’ll find a**Boleto**link. - QR Code Pix – go to the
**Invoices**option under**Finance**and select the invoices you want to pay, including any available credit notes. Click**Proceed to payment**, then**Continue to Pix**. Open your mobile banking app with your registered Pix key and choose**Pay with Pix**. Scan or copy and paste the QR code. You’ll have up to 15 minutes to complete the payment. If you start the payment and leave the screen, you’ll need to wait 15 minutes to generate a new QR code.

Find the payment methods available globally under **Finance** in the **Financial overview **option, under **Payment information**.

All invoices contain the payment steps you need to follow and whether any payment needs to be made under the Payment Due date.

Stripe Users, Hybrid BT, and Hybrid 2.0 BT receive an invoice with the gross amount of the reservations. A separate commission invoice will be issued, and then payment is due to Booking.com.

It can take approximately seven business days for received payments to reflect on the Extranet, so an invoice may stay marked as unpaid/overdue for a few days after you’ve paid it. You don’t need to send us proof of payment unless our Finance team asks for it, or in the event of a double invoice payment – in which case, reach out to Credit Control with proof of payment. You can also contact Credit Control to check the current balance in case of a short or overpayment.

Check out our dedicated article on payments and invoicing for multi-property partners to learn what to do if you’re on the multiple property payment plan.

**Checking or updating your current payment method**

To check your current payment method and bank details, sign in to the Extranet, click **Finance**, and select **Bank details **or** Financial settings**. You’ll be able to see the details of the bank account where you receive payouts, and if you pay by direct debit, the bank account from which you make payments.

If you make your payments via direct debit, you can update your current payment method or bank details by following these instructions:*

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Click the
**Finance**menu and select either**Bank details**or**Financial settings** - Click
**Edit bank details**

For any questions about your payment method, message us via the Extranet **inbox**. Select **Invoices and commission**, then **Other**. An agent will get back to you with information on payment methods available in your country, such as direct debit, online payments, or local payment providers.

**This isn’t possible for those in Slovenia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Denmark, or Norway – in which case, there are forms available on the Extranet.*

**Changing your invoicing language**

Your invoices and other financial documents are generated based on the language setting of either your invoicing contact or your primary point of contact.

To change the language of your financial documents:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click the
**account**icon on the top right corner of the page, then choose**Contacts.** - If you have a contact for
**Invoices**, click**Edit**and change the language. Click**Save changes**. - If you don’t have a contact for
**Invoices**, click**Edit**under**Primary point of contact**and change the language. Click**Save changes.**

Keep in mind that the new language setting will be applied only to documents generated in the future. Existing documents will stay the same.

**Corrections to your invoice**

If we send you an invoice with the wrong amount, we won’t send a new invoice. The original invoice will remain valid and we’ll issue a separate document with the amount to be deducted or added to the original invoice. This will either be a credit note or a debit note.

Keep in mind that credit notes can’t be refunded to your bank account – you can use them to pay future invoices. Read more on how credit notes work. If you receive a debit note, follow the instructions specified in it.

If you accidentally pay the same invoice twice or the wrong amount, the extra amount will be deducted from your next invoice. If you’d rather receive a refund, message us.

**Status of your invoice**

When checking the status of your invoices, you’ll see one of the following labels:

**Paid**–the invoice has been paid in full.**Due by month/day/year**–the invoice hasn’t been paid yet and is due for payment. Unpaid (or due) invoices are visible under**Outstanding balances**.**Overdue (due by month/day/year)**– the invoice is overdue and may lead to account suspension from our platform if not paid.

**You’ve paid X of X** – you’ve only paid part of your invoice. Or, if you requested to use a credit note for an invoice – you’ll also see the remaining balance under **Total amount due.** Make sure the invoice is paid in full by its due date.

**Written off **– because you didn’t pay on time, your property was permanently closed on our platform. Once we receive full payment for all outstanding invoices and they’re marked as **Paid**, you’ll be able to reopen your property listing or discuss reopening conditions. Learn more about how to reopen your property.

# Contacting guests

-
We understand the importance of being able to communicate with your guests before their arrival, whether it’s because you aren’t able to meet them in person or you need to share check-in information with them in advance. You have two options for communicating with them ahead of time:

- Log in to the Extranet and click
**Reservations** - Click the guest’s name or their reservation number
- On the
**Reservation details**page, scroll down to**Conversation with guest** - Type your message in the text field, click
**Templates**to select one of your message templates, then click**Send** - If you’d prefer to call your guest, you can see their contact number by clicking
**Show phone number**

Message templates are prepared responses that you can quickly send to save yourself the hassle of repeatedly typing the same message for different guests. You can add custom replies and image attachments to provide them with additional details and schedule information to be sent according to your preference. To create a new template or update an existing one, follow the steps in this article.

Get in touch with your guests as soon as possible, as they may be traveling or have limited access to their emails closer to the check-in date.

If you want to contact a guest about picking up keys, read

**this article on setting up the key collection feature**. - Log in to the Extranet and click
-
To ensure partner and guest information-sharing safety, we don’t support PDFs or QR codes as an attachment format – we only support images.

-
Use our messaging security settings to specify which email addresses you use to communicate with guests and which links can be shared in messages with guests.

-
You can help potential customers with quick answers by using the Extranet’s Guest Q&A feature. Create messaging templates with potential questions and answers already included, then schedule them to be sent before check-in or after booking. Learn more about how to set up messaging templates.

-
You can send messages from the time of booking until seven days after check-out or cancellation. If the guest sends a message to the reservation, you’ll have a 14-day window to reply. After one year after check-out or cancellation, you can’t read any messages.

-
There may be times when you can’t reach your guests but want to communicate with them before, during, or after their stays. To ensure your and your guests' security, we can’t share any personal information with either party. All communication should stay on the Booking.com platforms.

-
If you can't find the information on your “Reservation Statement,” contact our customer support team by following these instructions. To prevent this from happening in the future, you can add additional guest requirements on the Extranet to have more control over who can make bookings at your property.

-
We can’t delete messages shared between guests and partners due to legal requirements.

# Payout statements for multi-property partners on Payments by Booking.com with a bank transfer payout: FAQs

-
A payout statement is a report of the sums you receive via bank transfer from us. It contains all the reservations and transactions that contribute to your payouts, as well as breakdowns of commission, taxes, and other items.

-
Payout statements are generated each time a bank transfer toward you is made. This is based on your payout timing.

-
Here’s how you can download your payout statements:

- Sign in to the group Extranet.
- Click the
**Finance**menu, then**Financial Report.** - Find the payout report you want to download.
- Click “select the data” in the drop-down to customize what information you want to be included in your report.
- Choose to download your report in either PDF, CSV, or XLS file format.

Add an email reminder for up to five other people in your organization to return to the Extranet to download the report.

-
Reservations that weren't paid through Payments by Booking.com. Reservations that were paid at the property or reservations collected directly by you won’t appear in this report.

-
A blank report means you didn’t receive a payout during the selected reporting period.

## FAQs

-
If you’ve already completed the KYP form but are still receiving reminders, it could be because your properties are listed under multiple legal entities, each with its own Legal Entity ID number. Each legal entity is required to have its own KYP form. Submit the remaining forms for any other entities, or use your primary account to update your portfolio by moving all properties to a single legal entity.

-
If you need to update any of the information in the Know Your Partner (KYP) form after initial verification failure, you can do this by opening up the KYP form in the Extranet’s Compliance center or by clicking on the link in the emails you receive from us about this.

-
If your property is still active on our site, we’re required to ask you to complete the KYP form even if you haven’t added any availability.

If you want to remove your property or end your partnership with us, you can follow the steps in this article.

In this article, you’ll find answers to the most frequently asked questions about Payments by Booking.com, including information about virtual credit cards (VCCs) and bank transfers. Note that not all payment solutions are available in all countries or for all property types. We share rolling updates whenever these become available.

**Key takeaways**

- Payments by Booking.com facilitates your guest payments, then pays you via bank transfer or virtual credit card (VCC).
- A VCC is a temporary digital Mastercard linked to an existing credit card.
- If you’re paid by VCC, we’ll send you a new VCC for every relevant booking.
- If you’re paid by bank transfer, then you’ll be paid in daily, weekly, or monthly installments.

On your Extranet's

**Reservations**page, check the “Status” column of the reservation for a label showing “**Payment via Booking.com**.”This means Booking.com facilitates the guest’s payment, but please note that it doesn’t confirm when funds have been collected or transferred to your account.

-
Yes. Guests can have the option to pay online:

- By choosing to pay online (“Pay now” button) in the post-booking section – only available in some markets
- By choosing to pay online (“Pay now” button) – available for guests who had their credit card marked as invalid. This option is part of the invalid credit card process and will appear next to the option to update credit card details.

**Here’s how you’ll be informed that your guests paid online:**- You’ll get an email letting you know a modification was made and we collected the payment.
- The reservation page on the Extranet will be updated. Once the reservation is paid, you won’t be able to cancel it.
- The reservation details will be updated and appear as “Paid online.”
- Any mention of an invalid credit card will be removed from the reservation.

-
When a guest pays online, they receive a payment confirmation by email.

-
Check the Extranet to see if there are any banners or notifications about a payout delay. If there's no indication of a delay, send us a message through your

**Inbox**with the topic "Receiving my payouts." -
If your property is active on Payments by Booking.com and located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, or New Zealand, we manage payments for all reservations where guests pay in advance. To set up your payments service so that all your payments are managed by us online, you just need to add prepayment to all your available policies.

To do this, sign in to the Extranet, click the

**Property**menu, then**Policies**, and edit your policies to include prepayment.

Note: In some rare cases (e.g. reservations we receive through some third-party channels), we’re unable to charge guests, so your property might receive reservations with guest credit card details instead. -
Read more about opting out of Payments by Booking.com.

-
If you’re having issues seeing this info, contact your connectivity partner and ask them about these features:

**Extra information about the reservation (res_extra_info):**This feature allows your channel manager or PMS to indicate which reservation payments are facilitated by us.**Payments Clarity Package:**This feature lets you see your virtual credit cards’ balances, activations, and expiration dates in your channel manager or PMS.

We charge guests based on your policies and guarantee that guests will have paid in full before they arrive at your property. If the credit card info a guest provides is invalid—and they don’t update it or provide valid card info within 24 hours—we’ll automatically cancel the reservation. We won’t charge you commission for that booking if this happens.

-
You can see which payment method we’ll use for each booking under the

**Price**column on the Extranet’s**Reservations**page. You can also see the details of the payment method in the**Payment details**section on the**Reservation details**page for each booking. -
We include extra fees and charges in the amount we collect from guests when they pay online. The exception is for amounts broken down per person and that you’ve set to “excluded” on the Extranet. You’ll need to charge guests for these amounts yourself. You can see the breakdown of charges for each booking on the Extranet’s

**Reservation details**page. -
You can either decide to manage the damage deposits yourself or let us facilitate them on your behalf at no additional cost. Learn more about setting up damage policy options in this article.

You need to provide your guests with an invoice when they check out. This is because the reservation agreement is a direct transaction between you and your guest, not with Booking.com. You can provide the invoice on paper, by email, or both.

Here’s some more important information about invoices:

- We hold no responsibility for invoicing, and we don’t send invoices for any reservation to you or your guest.
- Make sure you issue invoices in your guest’s name, or another name you’ve agreed with them.
- For payouts you receive by VCC, the cardholder name will always be
**Booking.com (Agent).** - When we charge a guest, there may be tax implications for you. To learn more about local taxes, take a look at this article.
- You can export your invoices to use for tax declarations or other record keeping purposes.

For more information about invoices, take a look at this article.

-
When a guest uses a Booking Sponsored Benefit, we’ll cover a portion of the price so that the guest pays less. However, you should still provide them with an invoice for the full price. If a guest needs the documentation for tax or reimbursement purposes, then they should submit the receipt from you and the booking confirmation from us, which indicates the discount.

-
If you decide to refund a guest and we haven’t paid you for the reservation, we just won’t transfer the payout to you. Instead of paying you, we’ll refund the guest on your behalf.

If we’ve already paid you for the booking by bank transfer, we’ll deduct the amount we refund the guest from your next payout via bank transfer. If you’re not due to receive a payout at that time, you’ll need to pay us the amount we refunded to the guest. We’ll send you a debit note to let you know about this.

If we’ve already paid you for the booking using a virtual credit card—and you’ve already charged the VCC—you’ll need to refund it. To learn more about refunding VCCs, take a look at this article. If you haven’t charged the virtual credit card yet, you don’t need to do anything.

-
Yes, all properties using Payments by Booking.com can be booked with Wallet Credits. If your property doesn’t use Payments by Booking.com, you’ll need to opt in to be booked with Wallet Credits.

## Getting paid by virtual credit card (VCC)

-
A virtual credit card (VCC) is a temporary digital Mastercard linked to an existing credit card. It functions like a regular credit card and helps guests make secure online payments.

Here’s what you need to know about charging VCCs:

- For every relevant booking you receive, we’ll send you a new VCC.
- As long as each VCC stays active, you can charge it as many times as you like until the balance reaches zero.
- Each VCC has an activation date that's determined by whether the booking is refundable or not.

Find more info on VCCs here.

-
Here’s how to charge a VCC for a reservation that the guest paid for online:

- Sign in to the Extranet and click the
**Reservations**menu - Click the guest’s name or reservation number to view the
**Reservation details**page - Click
**View credit card details** - Enter the VCC details using your Point of Sale (POS) machine
- Charge the available
amount displayed

For a more detailed explanation of how to charge VCCs, watch this tutorial. If you use a channel manager or property management system (PMS), learn more about charging VCCs in this article.

- Sign in to the Extranet and click the
-
If something goes wrong when you try to charge a virtual credit card (VCC), you’ll be able to see the reason on the

**Reservations details**page about 30 minutes later. You can find some of the most common issues with charging VCCs in this article. -
If you receive a cancellation, no-show, or modification and are owed money, we’ll send you an email with updated virtual credit card (VCC) details.

-
If you’ve already charged a virtual credit card (VCC), there are two situations when you may need to refund it:

- You or your guest cancel or modify a booking or the guest doesn’t show up, and you agree to waive any fees that would apply.
- A reservation is canceled due to Force Majeure. In these cases, guests shouldn’t be charged for stays they can’t make and we waive commission on the affected reservations.

In both cases, we’ll refund the guest, and you’ll need to refund the same VCC you originally charged. To learn how to do this, take a look at this article.

-
When a guest makes a booking and pays for it online, we’ll send you a virtual credit card (VCC) along with the booking details. This card gives you access to the exact amount for that booking, and you can charge the virtual card as you would any credit card. Just make sure you do this after it's activated.

-
If you meet the following criteria, you can charge VCCs as soon as the reservation becomes non-refundable:

- You’ve paid your invoices on time for the last 12 months, according to the payment due dates
- You’ve been working with us for at least six months and have validated guest stays and reviews

We'll notify you by email if you qualify to charge your virtual credit cards before check-in.

We’ll review whether or not you meet these criteria every four months and will email you if anything changes.If you don’t meet the criteria during our review, then you can charge the VCCs one day after check-in, or at check-in for US properties. -
We’ll send you an email once a VCC is activated. You’ll have 365 days after the check-out date to charge the VCC. After that, the funds will belong to us because they’ll be considered financial breakage (i.e. revenue from services that were paid for but not used).

We’ll email you a weekly summary showing VCCs from check-outs in the last week with open balances. This isn’t a cumulative report on all uncharged VCCs – only about the previous week’s. You’ll be able to see the transaction details on the Extranet for 547 days (18 months) after the check-out date.

-
If you’re asked to enter a zip code when charging a virtual credit card (VCC), you can use the guest’s or your own zip code.

-
Your payment service provider will generally charge a fee between 2% and 3% for facilitating each transaction. The exact amount you’re charged may depend on local laws and any additional fees your bank may charge. For more information, contact your payment service provider.

-
Exchange rates don’t affect your payments if you've set the price of your rooms in the same currency you use to charge virtual credit cards (VCC).

If you receive a VCC in one currency but charge it in another, Mastercard will convert the amount using its own exchange rate. You can find out what this is on the Mastercard website.

-
You’ll pay commission for these bookings the same way as other bookings. Each payment you receive by virtual credit card (VCC) will be for the total gross amount of the booking. When we email you the VCC details, we’ll include a breakdown of the amount you’ve been paid. We’ll also invoice you separately for your commission fees.

-
If you’re eligible, here’s how you can switch from Virtual Credit Card to Bank Transfer:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Finance**, then**Finance settings.** - Click
**Payout method**and**edit payout method,**then follow the steps to proceed with the switch.

We currently only offer the option to switch from virtual credit card to bank transfer. We’re still working on introducing the switch from bank transfer to virtual credit card. If the option isn’t available on the Extranet, you can’t switch payout methods.

When you request a payout method switch, it will take five days to process. New reservations during that period will be moved to bank transfer – you’ll be informed through the Extranet if the switch fails.


## Getting paid by bank transfer

-
Find out if you’re eligible here.

-
This depends on the payment schedule you've set up and your bank. It can take a few days before the payment reaches your account.

**If you’re set up for monthly payments,**we’ll process payments by the 15th day of the month after the guest checks out.**If you’re set up for weekly payments,**we’ll process payments every Thursday for reservations where the guest checked out during the previous week, which runs from Thursday until Wednesday. If the Thursday when we'd usually process your payment is a public holiday, we’ll process it on the next business day.**If you’re set up for daily payments**, we’ll process payments one day after check-out. We don’t process payments on weekends and public holidays. Note: At the moment, the possibility to have daily payments is limited to select countries. We’re working toward expanding this feature to more countries.

To check or change your payment schedule, sign in to the Extranet, click on the

**Finance**menu, and select**Finance settings**and then**Payout timing**to select your preferred payout schedule. -
Here’s how to download your commission invoices:

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to
**Finance****,**then**Invoices** - Choose the year you want to filter by
- Click on “Download PDF” under the number of the invoice you want to download

To see the reservations included in each invoice, click

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to
**Finance****,**then**Payout information** - Click on the arrow next to the period you’re interested in seeing a list of reservations for
- Click
**PDF**or**CSV**to download the payout document

-
Depending on the country you’re in and payment model you’re using, your payment will either be gross or net.

If you receive a gross payout, we’ll pay you the total amount of your reservations. We’ll then invoice you for commission normally. Your commission invoice will include all bookings from the previous period, including any bookings that weren’t paid for online.

If you receive a net payout, we’ll pay you the total amount of your reservations minus the total amount of all your invoices. You won’t have to pay commission separately.

-
Here’s how to change the bank details we use to pay you:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Go to the
**Finance**menuand then click on**Finance settings**. - Under
**Receiving payouts from Booking.com**, click**Add bank details**or**Edit bank details**. - Enter your new bank details.
- Click “Update bank details.”

It can take up to five business days for your bank details to update in our system. If you change your bank details again while they’re updating, the update time resets back to five days.

Once the bank details are updated and confirmed, the next payout will be sent to your bank account according to your selected payout timing – daily, weekly, or monthly. To learn more about updating your bank details, watch this tutorial.

-
To list a property on Payments by Booking.com with a foreign bank account, you can’t accept credit card payments and have your property listed in a country that belongs to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). For countries outside of SEPA, the bank account has to be located in the same country as the property is listed.

-
Exchange rates don’t affect your payments if you set the price of your rooms in the same currency as we make your bank transfer payment in. If the currency you set your rooms in isn’t the same as the one we make your bank transfer payment in, we’ll convert the amount using the rate of a third-party service provider the day before we send your remittance advice.

If we make your bank transfer payment in a different currency from the one of your bank account, your bank will convert the amount using their own exchange rate. To find out what this is, contact your bank directly.

To find out which currency we’ll make your bank transfer payment in, check the payout document we email you each month. To download these payout documents, follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet
- Go to
**Finance****,**then**Payout information** - Click on the arrow next to the period you’re interested in seeing a list of reservations for
- Click
**PDF**or**CSV**to download the payout document

-
The total amount shown on your invoice only includes amounts we charge commission on, such as room rates. The total reservation amount on your remittance advice is the total amount we’ve collected from guests on your behalf. This includes room or unit rates plus any additional fees, unless they’ve been broken down per person and you’ve set them as

**excluded**on the Extranet. We don’t charge you commission for these excluded fees. -
If the amount of your commission invoice is higher than the amount we pay you by bank transfer, we’ll collect the difference from your bank account. We need you to set up Direct Debit to allow us to do this unless Direct Debits aren’t available in your country.

To learn more about paying your commission invoice by Direct Debit, check out this article.

-
Depending on your property’s location and settings, we only offer the option to switch from Virtual credit card to Bank transfer at this point (see VCC section). We’re working on introducing the switch from Bank transfer to Virtual credit card – we’ll inform you when it becomes available in your market.

# Changing your property description or room details

Your property page description is automatically generated based on the information you provide on the Extranet. When you correct or change your facilities, room details, or location on the Extranet, the corresponding information in your property page description updates automatically.

## What's on this page:

**How the property description is generated**

We use your facilities, location details, and other items from your property info to auto-generate a property description containing the most relevant information for potential guests. This description appears under the photos on your property page.

We’re always working to optimize these descriptions. We keep them relevant by always offering new options to add, like mentioning more facilities and services, improving location information, or adjusting priorities as users’ needs evolve.

Auto-generated content is highly effective at attracting potential guests, provided best practices for creating and updating property descriptions are followed:

- We’ve done extensive research for various segments of travelers to understand what they most want to read in a property description.
- We use guest behavior data on our website to determine the length, style, and structure of our descriptions. For example, we know guests spend an average of less than one minute reading property descriptions, so our auto-generated descriptions are short.
- We’re focused on optimizing for search engines, so people can discover your property faster when they search for accommodations. We don’t copy/paste or duplicate text because this affects search engine optimization (SEO) and may make your property harder to find online.
- Auto-generated descriptions are available in 36 languages and are updated in real time. Descriptions in some languages aren’t direct translations of the English description, so there may be some discrepancies between languages. We’re working on automating description generation in another 11 languages in the foreseeable future.
- We use a unified tone of voice and language across all descriptions to help users find the information they’re looking for faster and choose the right property for them.

**Use the ****fine print section** to add any other information about your property that guests must know before booking, and that can’t be shared elsewhere on the property page. For legal reasons, we can’t include any mandatory costs, taxes, deposit information, or cancellation/payment policies in the fine print.

**Keeping your information up to date**

Since we use information you provide on the Extranet, it’s important that your facilities, location details, and room information is up to date. Make sure you add all facilities and amenities available at your property to give the most comprehensive description. You can learn more in our Updating your property page and host profile article.

**Correcting info in your description**

The goal of auto-generated property descriptions is to make sure they’re easy for guests to find and understand, and that your information is always up to date as you make changes to your rooms, facilities, and location.

We don’t change these auto-generated descriptions unless there’s a factual discrepancy. If something is incorrect regarding the property type, facilities, or location information you’ve provided, here’s how you can fix it:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Property**, then**View your descriptions**. - For changes to your property description, click
**Spotted a typo? Request a fix**and describe the fix you need in the text field that appears. - For changes to your
room description(s), click**Request a correction**below the room you’d like to update, then describe the fix you need in the text field that appears. - Click
**Request a fix**.

Our content team will revise your requested changes and advise on the next steps.

Note: It isn’t possible for you to manually adjust the number of years mentioned in the part of the auto-generated description that says “Has been welcoming guests since [date].”

**Updating your facilities and services**

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Property**, then**Facilities & services**. - Update the facilities and services available at your property.
- Click
**Save**.

**You can update your facilities and services on the go using Pulse.**

**Updating your room amenities**

It’s important guests know what to expect when they arrive at your property. If the information about amenities available at your property isn’t up to date, here’s how to change it:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Property**, then**Room amenities**. - For each room amenity, check or uncheck the box to show whether it applies to
**all rooms**or just**some rooms**. You’ll then be able to specify which rooms it applies to. - Click
**Save**.

**Updating your location and changing position on the map**

Property location features in the description, so it's important that the geographical location is correct. If your property’s location appears to be inaccurate and you’d like to change the geographical coordinates we display on our platform, follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Inbox**, then**Booking.com messages**. - Click
**See contact options**. - Choose
**Property****details**as the topic and**Adjust your location on the map**as the subtopic. - Click
**Update map location**. - In the map that opens, click and drag the red pin to where you want your property to show up on the map.
- Click
**Save new location**, then**Done**.

We’ll update the distances mentioned in your property information within 48 hours.

Keep in mind that your property’s location on the map needs to accurately reflect where it is actually located based on your address. If you move the red pin too far, we’ll suggest updating your property’s address to make sure it’s correct. Moving the pin also affects distances to local landmarks and places of interest.

Read more about changing your property’s location.

**Changing your property layout and room or unit details**

You can change other property details like property layout and room type based on maximum occupancy by following these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Property**, then**Property layout**or**Room details**. - Click
**Edit**. - Change information such as room type, room name, location, bed options, occupancy, and bathroom details.
- Click
**Continue**.

You can edit room names to create custom names for personal reference on the Extranet, but only you can see your custom names there – travelers don’t see these on our platform.

Before you can start receiving bookings, you’ll need to add your number of rooms and units and their availability to your profile. Check out this article to learn how to add, open, close, and delete rooms and units.

You can also customize the names of your rooms or units, change the room or unit type, and adjust maximum occupancy for individual rooms or units. Finally, it’s a good idea to add room facilities. This gives potential guests a clear idea of what they can expect at your property.


**Adding property facilities**

You can list the facilities available at your property to better manage guest expectations. On the Extranet’s **Facilities and services** page, you’ll find **Top facilities** – those that guests search for the most. If you don’t see a specific facility on the Extranet, we suggest either selecting a closely related one or adding the information to **About the property**. You’ll find this on the Extranet by clicking **Property**, then **Your profile**. Read more about updating your facilities.


**Your property description**

We use your facilities, location details, and other information from your property page to auto-generate descriptions that contain the most relevant information. These descriptions are automatically generated in multiple languages and appear under your photos on your property page.

Auto-generated content is highly effective at attracting guests because it’s:

**Always up to date** – Auto-generating the description means it’s guaranteed to be an up-to-date reflection of the facilities you’ve chosen on the Extranet. **Attention-grabbing** – Our data shows that guests don’t read the whole description. With auto-generated content, our descriptions are short and concise, and they contain only the key traveler information.**Easily discoverable online** – With SEO-optimized, auto-generated content, your property is more easily found in search results.**Instantly available in 25 languages** – We market your property all around the world in at least 25 supported languages, updated in real-time. Descriptions in some languages aren’t direct translations of the English description, so some discrepancies are possible. **Accurate** – Our data shows that the information in auto-generated descriptions is more accurate than in manually written descriptions.

We don’t change these auto-generated descriptions unless there’s a factual inaccuracy. If you find incorrect information, you can follow these instructions to change your property description.


**Adding photos**

Our data shows that guests typically stay only ten seconds on a page before leaving. Photos are the most engaging form of content, and the best way to boost bookings is by showing how unique your property is.

You’ll need to upload at least one photo of your property to sign up for our platform, but we recommend adding as many as possible. You can always add, change, or delete them later. Read more about which photos you need for a home, apartment, or vacation rental and what photos attract families.


**Updating your profile**

You can update your profile by adding personalized information – these are the things that make you, your property, and your neighborhood unique.

Completing your profile tells guests more about yourself and what makes your place special. It paints a complete picture of your property and shows potential guests that you’re an authentic person.

Descriptions should be personable yet professional, so make sure to include relevant information about yourself and your property as well as the surrounding area. You can even write a welcome message for future guests. You can update the information via the Extranet or the Pulse app by following the steps below.

# Setting up length of stay and advance reservation restrictions

Setting up length of stay and advance reservation restrictions can give you more control over your bookings. They prevent travelers from booking a stay that’s shorter or longer than you’d like, or with too much or too little notice.

You can add, change, or remove restrictions via your Extranet calendar or using the Pulse app.

**In this article**

**Understanding length of stay and advance reservation restrictions**

These restrictions determine how travelers can book a stay at your property, based on your preferences. If you apply these restrictions, potential guests can only make a reservation with you when their search criteria match the conditions you’ve set.

Minimum length of stay restrictions determine the minimum number of nights guests can book at your property. Minimum advance reservation restrictions determine how far before the check-in date a guest can book a stay with you.

You can apply a minimum length of stay restriction of up to 31 nights. For example, if you set a minimum length of stay restriction of three nights, your property won’t appear in the search results of travelers looking for two- or one-night stays.

You can also set up length of stay restrictions that only apply to bookings with specific check-in dates. These are known as minimum length of stay from arrival restrictions.

You can set minimum and/or maximum advance reservations for specific rooms or properties on specific dates. Our system counts backwards from midnight on the check-in date, which means you can set restrictions both in terms of days (D) as well as hours (H) before check-in. For example:

- If you want guests to book at least one day before check-in, the minimum advance reservation time is one day. You would then enter 1D in our system.
- If you want to allow same-day bookings until 6 pm, the minimum advance reservation time is six hours (counting backwards from midnight). You would then enter 6H in our system.
- If you want guests to book at least three days and five hours in advance, the minimum advance reservation time is three days. You would enter 3D5H in our system.
- If you don’t want guests to book more than ten days in advance, the maximum advance reservation time is ten days. You would then enter 10D in our system.

Once you set your reservation restrictions, your property will only appear in search results when guests’ search dates match these restrictions. The more restrictions you set, the fewer potential guests will see your property. Learn more about all restrictions


In the following sections, we describe the possible ways to set restrictions, depending on which Extranet calendar view you use.

**Managing restrictions using the List view calendar**

If you’re using the List view** **calendar, here’s how to apply and edit restrictions to your rooms and rates:

# Updating your rates and availability

You can increase your visibility in search results and attract early bookers by loading rates and availability well in advance. You can update your rates and availability via your calendar on the Extranet, either in the list or monthly view. Be sure to load prices for any dates you’ve opened, so potential guests can see and book those rooms or units. Travelers can book up to 16 months in advance.

Reminder – your rates may not be displayed in the currency of your choice. The currency is set up on the Extranet as a default option and can’t be switched because of internal processes related to payments and billings.

## What's on this page:

**Managing your availability**

Watch this video to learn how to easily manage your property’s availability using the Extranet calendar:

**Updating your rates and availability in list view**

If you're viewing your calendar in list view, follow these steps to update your rates and availability:

- Log in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Rates & Availability**and then on**Calendar**. - Find the room or unit type you’d like to update availability for, then adjust how many of them you want to sell and on which dates in the
**Rooms to sell**row. - You can then edit the price for that room type in the
**Rate plan**row. **To make changes for multiple days at once**, click a cell and drag the blue slider across all the dates you want to apply the change to. Add the number of rooms or units and the price per night in the pop-up box that appears, then click**Save**.**To make changes for more than one month at once**, click**Bulk edit**for the room or unit type you want to update. In the panel that appears, select how many rooms or units you’d like to sell on which dates and for what price, then click**Save changes**.**To make changes for multiple room or unit types at once**, click**Bulk edit**, then select**Multiple room types**when the panel appears. Adjust the number of rooms or units to sell for the ones you want to update, then click**Save changes**.

Note: It may take a few minutes to see your availability refreshed on the platform. If you’re working with a connectivity provider, factor in possible delays from the provider.

If you work with a connectivity provider, you may not be able to use the Bulk edit option in the Extranet calendar view. In some instances, if you’re using a PMS or channel manager, you might be able to use the Bulk edit function, but your connectivity provider will override calendar changes the next time it syncs. Use your connectivity provider’s software to update your property’s availability on our platform. Read this article to learn how to manage your availability through your connectivity provider.

**Updating your rates and availability in monthly view**

If you're viewing your calendar in monthly view, follow these steps to update your rates and availability: Keep in mind that the monthly view isn’t always available to partners using a channel manager.

- Log in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Rates & Availability**and then on**Calendar**. - In the drop-down menu, select the room or unit you’d like to update.
- Select the date or date range that you’d like to update by clicking and dragging the slider in the calendar, or by selecting the
**Start date**and**End date**in the panel. Click the**Advanced date selection**drop-down if you’d like to specify which weekdays you’d like the changes to apply to. - In the panel, specify the number of rooms or units you’d like to sell for that room or unit type, which Rate Plans apply, how much you’ll charge, and whether it’s non-refundable (this option is available to properties that only have one Rate Plan). You can also add or adjust restrictions to your Rate Plans here.
- To be available for travelers to book, make sure the days you’re applying the rates to also have rooms or units marked
**Open**for bookings. - Scroll down and click
**Save**to apply the changes.

Note: It may take a few minutes to see your availability refreshed on the platform.

**Checking if your property is open and bookable**

You can check the Extranet calendar to see when your property is available to book and when it isn’t. You can also see this info on the Pulse app. Different colors indicate the status of your rooms or units:

**Green**–your room or unit is open and available to book on that date**Red**– your room or unit isn’t available to book on that date

There are several reasons for a room or unit not being available to book. You’ll see one of these reasons in the red badge under the name of the room or unit in your list view calendar:

**Closed**– you closed this room or unit. If using Pulse, you can make it open and bookable again by switching the toggle to the right. To do this on the Extranet calendar, click the**Rooms to sell**row – the room should automatically turn from red to green.**No inventory**– you haven’t added any inventory to your rooms or units yet or you’ve reduced your inventory to**0**. To make it open and bookable again, add inventory.**Price missing**– you haven’t added a price to your Rate Plan. To make your room or unit open and bookable again, add at least one price to a Rate Plan attached to this room or unit.**Rate closed**– your Rate Plans for that date are closed. To make your room or unit open and bookable again, open at least one Rate Plan that’s attached to this room or unit.**Multiple blockers**– a combination of issues is preventing your room or unit from being bookable. Click the**Rooms to sell**row to see exactly which issues need to be addressed.**Sold out**– the rooms or units you’re selling on our platform have all been booked for that date. If you have more availability and want to become open and bookable again, add availability to a room or unit.**Fully booked**– all your rooms or units have been booked for that date (this only applies to the Pulse app).

If your property doesn’t appear on the search page, make sure your rooms and units:

- Were added to your inventory
- Are open for bookings
- Have open rate plans set up
- Have a price added to each rate plan

Remember – to specify how much you want to charge for reservations, you need to add the price in your Extranet calendar for each date and room type in the **Rate plan** row.

It’s also possible that the restrictions you’ve set are affecting your property’s visibility on our platform. For example, when you only accept bookings for a minimum number of nights, your property won’t appear in search results for fewer nights than your set minimum. Also, if your minimum length of stay restriction is higher than the number of consecutive days you have available, you won’t appear in the search results.

# Everything you need to know about virtual credit cards

Learn how to charge a guest's credit card

Virtual credit cards (VCCs) are temporary digital Mastercards we use to pay out partners through Payments by Booking.com. They work like regular credit cards and guarantee payouts when you’re owed money. You don’t need to pre-authorize or validate them, which can save time.

## What's on this page:

## How virtual credit cards work

**How virtual credit cards work**

VCC is one of the payout methods we use to pay partners who use our Payments by Booking.com service. If guests pay online, they can do so using their preferred payment method. We then load that payment onto a VCC that you can charge like a regular credit card with a point of sale (POS) system. A point of sale (POS) system that accepts VCCs is required for this payout method.

Here’s how you can find out if your property is eligible to join Payments by Booking.com with a VCC payout method:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click the
**Finance**menu - Click
**Payments by Booking.com**

A few things to keep in mind about how we’ll send you payments from VCCs, how to charge them, and how long they remain valid:

- We’ll send you a new VCC for every new booking you receive that’s payable via Payments by Booking.com. Each VCC has a unique card number, expiration date, and CVC.
- Every new VCC you receive will be activated according to the reservation policy. For non-refundable bookings, this is the same date as the booking date. For all other reservations, you can charge the VCC when the reservation becomes at least 90% non-refundable. If you’re a new property or don’t follow these criteria, you’ll be able to charge the VCC one day after check-in (at check-in for partners in the US).

Here's how you can see which reservations have been paid for and which have an active VCC:

- On the
**Virtual cards management**page, you'll find details on all VCCs that still need to be charged or refunded. - Based on the activation date, you can enter the VCC details in your POS system and charge the VCC as you would any other credit card to receive your payment.
- All VCCs need to be charged within 12 months of the guest check-out date. After this point, the card will become inactive and we won’t reissue a new VCC for the reservation.
- We’ll send you reminder emails after the check-out date if you haven't charged the card yet.
- You can charge a VCC multiple times until the balance reaches zero.

We don’t charge any fees for partners on Payments by Booking.com using VCC as a payout method. However, your payment service provider may charge you a fee for using a VCC. Read more about how much Payments by Booking.com costs.


**Charging virtual credit cards**

To charge a VCC, follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click
**Reservations**. - Click the guest’s name or reservation number.
- Click
**View credit card details**. - Enter the VCC’s details using your POS system.
- Charge the full balance available in your VCC. The available balance can be found in the VCC details, reservation details, or in
**Virtual cards management**.

You can also see all your available VCCs by clicking **Finance** and selecting **Virtual cards management**. Keep in mind that you’ll need to be signed in with admin access or an account with Reservations access rights to see the card details.

If you use a property management system or channel manager, you can find your VCC under each reservation’s payment details. If you don't see this information, contact your connectivity provider for further assistance.


**What to do if you’re having trouble charging a virtual credit card**

Here are the most common issues with charging VCCs and what to do to resolve them:

POS error messages:

**“Do not honor/the VAN can’t be authorized prior to activation date”**– Check the activation date on the Extranet’s**Reservations**page to make sure the card is already active.**“Do not honor/insufficient funds”**– Check that the amount you’re charging isn't higher than the VCC balance and try again. Keep in mind that certain fees and taxes may be excluded from the price. These fees are typically set on a per-person basis. In that case, you'll need to collect them directly from the guest during their stay. You can see the amount available on the VCC and the charge breakdown for each booking on the**Reservations**page.**“Do not honor/invalid CVC or expiration date”**– Check that the CVC code and expiration date you entered are correct.**“Invalid merchant”**– If your POS machine merchant code is invalid, contact your payment service provider for help. You can only charge VCCs if you’re a merchant registered as an accommodation provider, but you can change your code if necessary.

VCC operations errors:

**Security lock**– You’ve had too many failed charge attempts in a short period of time. Try again in 24 to 48 hours.**Using the same currency to charge the VCC as the currency used to load the VCC**– Using a different currency doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t charge a VCC, but it can lead to two potential issues:**Partial charges**– You might end up charging less than the amount available on the card, meaning funds may remain on the card. Always make sure your card has no money left.**Insufficient funds error**– Attempting to charge more than the available balance on the VCC can result in an “insufficient funds” error.

**Don’t pre-authorize the VCC**– If you have, you should either settle the authorized amount with the provided authorization code or cancel the authorization and charge it again.**Enter your, your guest’s, or our zip code**– If you’re asked to enter a zip code when you charge the VCC, you can use the guest’s, your own, or ours (1011 DL).**Make sure your POS machine supports charging virtual cards**– Contact your payment service provider for assistance. They might be able to offer you a different POS that supports online charging service.**Your card has a zero balance**– Make sure your card is already active to be charged. If the card is active but displays “zero,” it can be due to the few seconds/minutes a card needs to be loaded. If you’re seeing a “zero” balance, your provider may not have updated the system with the amount that was loaded onto the card. You can check the amount to charge on the Extranet.**Incorrect amount**– If you charged the card, you can refund the amount and charge again.

All our virtual cards are valid, so there’s no need to test-authorize them. If you’re not seeing the VCC details, it’s because the card isn’t active yet.

If you’re still having trouble charging the VCC, contact us via the Extranet inbox. Learn more about charging VCCs in our tutorial.


**How virtual credit cards work with cancellations, no-shows, and modifications**

If you’re owed money because a reservation was canceled, modified, or the guest was a no-show, you’ll be able to charge the VCC as per the reservation policy.

Depending on the cancellation date, you can charge the VCC as follows:

- If cancellation happened before April 18, 2024, you can charge a cancellation fee on the supposed check-in date.
- If cancellation takes place after April 18, 2024, you can charge a cancellation fee as soon as the reservation is canceled.

If you agreed to waive the applicable fees for the cancellation, modification, or no-show but have already charged the VCC, you'll need to refund the same VCC. You can do this even if the card has expired – just enter the current month as the expiration date instead. Learn more about refunding VCCs.


**How to deactivate virtual credit card payments**

Here’s how to deactivate VCC payments if your property is based in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click the
**Finance**menu - Click
**Finance help**to check if there’s an option to switch from VCC to bank transfer payout. If so, there’s no need to opt out of Payments by Booking.com – you can start getting paid via bank transfer.

If your property is based outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland and you want to disable VCC payments, you need to opt out of Payments by Booking.com since we don't offer the option to switch from VCC to bank transfer in your region. Here’s how:

- Sign in to the Extranet.
- Click the
**Finance**menu - Click
**Finance settings**.

Under **Payments by Booking.com**, click **Deactivate Payments by Booking.com**.
