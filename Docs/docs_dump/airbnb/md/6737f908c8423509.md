# Updating your availability

*Updated Jul 14, 2025*

Airbnb’s availability settings make it easy to control when and how guests book your place. You’ll find them in your calendar.

Pricing tools and availability settings often work together. For example, if you offer an early bird discount, allowing guests to book 12 or 24 months in advance can help you reach more guests who plan ahead.

## Adjusting your trip length

Changing your trip length can open your calendar and help your listing appear in more search results. Just make sure your minimum and maximum trip lengths follow local rules and regulations.

**Minimum nights:**Lowering your minimum trip length appeals to guests booking short stays and helps fill gaps in your calendar. You can set a minimum night stay based on the day of check-in.**Maximum nights:**Increasing your maximum trip length helps attract guests booking longer stays, which reduces turnovers. You can also allow requests for stays that are longer than your maximum. You’ll be able to review and approve these requests.**Custom trip length:**Adding a custom trip length that’s shorter than your minimum trip length for certain dates can help you fill gaps in your calendar.

Nights will automatically be available based on your settings. If your settings are blocking dates, you’ll find tips to unblock them. For example, if your minimum length of stay is 5 nights and you have 4 unbooked nights between reservations, you’ll see a tip to lower your trip minimum for those nights.

## Managing your availability

Decide how much notice you need before guests arrive and how far in advance people can book.

**Advance notice:**Decide how much time you need between a guest’s booking and their arrival. You can select the same day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 7 days. Even if you choose 1 day or more, you can allow requests with less than a day’s notice, which you’ll need to review and approve.**Same-day notice:**If you allow guests to book on the same day as check-in, you set the cut-off time after which they can no longer book. Select any hour between 6:00 AM and 12:00 AM.**Preparation time:**Choose how many nights you need to block off before and after each reservation. The options are none, 1 night before and after each reservation, or 2 nights before and after each reservation.**Availability window:**Extending how far in advance guests can book helps your listing appear in more search results. Select 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 months ahead.**More availability settings:**You can restrict guests from checking in or out on certain days of the week. This blocks your calendar from arrivals or departures if you know you’re unavailable on certain days. You can select up to 6 days per week.

## Connecting your calendars

If you use multiple calendars, syncing all your hosting calendars helps prevent double bookings. This 2-way connection automatically updates both calendars when a night is booked. To connect your calendars:

- Add the provided Airbnb calendar link to the other website.
- Get a link ending in .ics from the other website and add it to your Airbnb calendar.
