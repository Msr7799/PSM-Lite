As a host, you’re always in charge of your prices. You can change it at any time—you’re in control.

You can set your nightly price when you create your listing in your Airbnb setup. The price you set applies to all future nights, and you can edit your nightly price any time in your Calendar through **Pricing**.

You can also set a custom nightly price for any night by selecting and editing the night in your calendar.

Your nightly price includes the price you set per night at your home and base price for accommodations. The base price is your payout, which includes any additional fees that you charge and excludes the host service fee.

Your nightly price will also include applicable taxes in countries with existing price display requirements. Check out your nightly price breakdown.
