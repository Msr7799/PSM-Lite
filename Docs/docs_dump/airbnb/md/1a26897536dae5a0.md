Your exact map location is available to confirmed guests, but what about potential guests in public search? You can choose how your location is shown by enabling/disabling Show your specific location. If you enable this option, your listing will show a small circle with greater accuracy, but not the exact point.

**Note:** For hosts in the Airbnb-friendly program who enable this option, your listing will display a small circle with greater accuracy. It will also allow Airbnb or your building to promote your listing, which may associate your listing with your building’s name and address. For example, your listing may be featured on your building’s Airbnb-friendly details page.
