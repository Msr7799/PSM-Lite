Ready to host? Fantastic. Just set up a payout method and prepare to welcome your guests.

The first payout method you add is automatically set to be your default method. If you set up more than one payout method, you can choose a default.

In some countries, we'll confirm your account info by depositing a small amount (less than $1 USD) before sending you a payout. This usually happens when a new payout method is added.

When it’s ready, the earnings will be released to your payout method for processing. You can check the status of your earnings at any time from your earnings dashboard.
