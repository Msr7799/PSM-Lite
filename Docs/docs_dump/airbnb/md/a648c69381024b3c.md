You can print payout details for individual reservations or export all payouts and transactions from a set period of time in a CSV file.

The CSV file can be opened by any standard spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, or Apple Numbers). This spreadsheet includes additional information, like transaction history, Host service fees or cleaning fee (if you charge one) as well as gross earnings and any taxes withheld for each earning.
