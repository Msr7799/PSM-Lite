If you host on other websites, you can sync all of your hosting calendars to prevent multiple guests from booking the same dates. For example, when a night is booked on one calendar, it’ll automatically block on the other—keeping your schedule up-to-date and making hosting administration a little easier.

To export, we’ll give you a URL that you’ll paste into the other website’s calendar—this will send information from your Airbnb calendar to the other website (for example, VRBO or Booking.com), or you can export to a personal calendar (like Google or Apple).

Once you export, changes on your Airbnb calendar will be reflected automatically on the other website’s calendar, depending on their website settings.

To import, you’ll need to get a URL from the other website’s calendar and add it to Airbnb. On most websites, you can find this in a section dedicated to calendar importing and exporting. Tip: Make sure the URL ends in .ics, because other URLs won’t work.

Nights that you block—or that are booked on Airbnb—will be blocked on the other website’s calendar. Your Airbnb calendar will include nights that are blocked for your availability settings, preparation time, advance notice, and minimum stays.

Nights booked on another website’s calendar will be automatically blocked on Airbnb when you’ve connected them to your Airbnb calendar. However, nights that you block on another calendar may or may not be blocked on Airbnb—this can include preparation time or advance notice settings that you’ve set on other calendars.

Your Airbnb calendar automatically updates every 3 hours, and pulls in information from the other calendars you’ve connected. To check your latest availability sooner than 3 hours, you can go to your connected calendar and select **Refresh**.

If you’ve connected multiple calendars, they may automatically update at different times. We’ll show the latest time that each calendar was updated, and you can manually refresh them as well.

Note that we’re only able to request updates from the other website so many times—if you exceed that amount of updates, you’ll need to wait until the next automatic update.

We import up to 2 years of data. You can’t pause an imported calendar. You’d need to disconnect the calendar and reconnect it when you’re ready to sync your calendars again. To remove a synced calendar, click or tap **Edit** and then **Disconnect Calendar**.
