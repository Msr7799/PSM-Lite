You can only edit your listing address before you accept your first booking. Once guests have stayed there, or if you have an upcoming reservation, you’ll need to contact us to change it. If you’ve moved or you’re listing a new place, you’ll need to create a new Airbnb listing.

You can also customize how your listing is shown on the map to be more general or specific in public search results. But for safety and convenience, always provide confirmed guests with your listing’s exact address and map location.

If your listings are in **Japan**, **Malaysia**, **Vietnam**, **Thailand**, **Indonesia**, **or the Philippines**, our system may automatically check your listing address for missing information. We’ll reach out via email or notification if your listing needs to be updated.

If your listing has upcoming reservations, we’ll make sure to let your guests know about any address changes. We still recommend reaching out to guests directly with any additional directions or specific instructions for finding your place.
