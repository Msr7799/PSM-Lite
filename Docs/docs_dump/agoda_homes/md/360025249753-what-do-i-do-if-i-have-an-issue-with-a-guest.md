Occasionally, problems with guests may arise. We strongly recommend you follow these guidelines to resolve the issue:



**Stay calm!** Listen to the guest carefully and make sure you’ve heard everything. Listen rather than reacting.


**Acknowledge the problem**. Let the guest know you hear what they are saying. You don’t have to agree with the guest, but you need to consider their perspective.


**Offer a solution**. This shows that you are willing to take ownership of the problem. Keep in mind not to make promises you can’t keep.
