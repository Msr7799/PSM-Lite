Reviews speak volumes about your property. Our studies have shown that the number of reviews and the review score for each property have an impact on the bookings for the property. Each review is a message from the guest for you, and we encourage you to respond to them graciously. Your response to the guest reviews allows you to thank your guests for their kind words and address any grievances that the guest may have had. All of these communicate to future guests that you care.

Your responses take about 48 hours to get published on our platform.

To respond to a guest review, go to the **Listings** page, **Bookings & Earnings**, **Bookings** tab, and then click **See reviews**. You can respond in 31 different languages.


May 26, 2020: Published guest reviews and your responses will be displayed on the property page
