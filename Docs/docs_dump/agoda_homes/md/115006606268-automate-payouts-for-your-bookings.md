Properties receiving booking payouts through bank transfer or PayPal can enable Auto-pay to automatically initiate payouts, removing the need for you to manually approve bookings.



Auto-pay bookings are processed within 24 hours after the guest checks out and will be paid out based on the conditions you set. Once paid out, earnings will be sent to your account within 3-5 business days.
