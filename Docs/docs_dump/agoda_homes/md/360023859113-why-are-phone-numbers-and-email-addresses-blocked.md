Agoda is able to protect the safety and security of guests and hosts by facilitating communication through the platform while keeping phone numbers and email addresses private. We cannot provide this security for communications that occur outside of the Agoda platform. With that said, we do plan to alter our policy in the future to allow guests and hosts to exchange email and phone number once bookings are confirmed.
