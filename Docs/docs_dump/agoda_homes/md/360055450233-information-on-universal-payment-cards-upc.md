The Universal Payment Cards (UPC) payout method is available only for properties with a credit card machine that allows them to charge the virtual credit card number without a physical card. If you wish to set up UPC as your property’s preferred payout method, please contact us.

Note: For security reasons, the UPC number is not visible on the booking voucher. It can only be found on Host Manage. For non-refundable bookings, the charge can be made on the booking date. For all other bookings, the charge can be made only after guest check-out. Do not charge or pre-authorize these cards before the guest check-out as the card will be declined and will become void. Please charge only the amount that is reflected on the booking details; charging any other amount (such as parking fees or other fees) will make the transaction void. UPC payments may be processed up to 150 days after check-out.

You may find UPC details for each booking and process your payouts through the web. Go to the **Listings** page and click **Payment accounts**. Click **GET PAID**.
