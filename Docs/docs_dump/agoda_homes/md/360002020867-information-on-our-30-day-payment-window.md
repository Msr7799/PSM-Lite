The first payment for your property (based on the first check-out date) is withheld for 30 days after guest departure in order to ensure safety and security for the guest. This 30-day payment window applies to all properties with preferred payout methods of direct deposit to bank and Paypal. This window is also applicable for any bookings and/or check-outs during that 30-day window. Once the 30-day window has passed without any dispute, all payouts will be **PROCESSED within** 24-hours of guest departure if your property is on Auto Pay, or within 1-3 days if you are manually requesting the payments. Payouts will then be sent to the bank within 3-5 business days

If you have listed multiple properties on Agoda, the 30-day payment window will apply to each of your properties. After you receive the first payout for any one property and wish to skip the 30-day payment window condition for other properties under your account, please contact us.

Once your request is approved, any payment for future bookings will be processed within 1-3 days of guest departure.
