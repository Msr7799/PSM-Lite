When guests cancel their bookings on Agoda, you will receive a cancellation email notification from us. Guests will be automatically refunded according to the cancellation policy you have set up for your property.

If a confirmed guest contacts you with similar requests, please let him know to reach out to us to facilitate the process. If you need to cancel or modify a confirmed reservation, please note that you can only do so by contacting us on the Agoda Hotline, indicated on the booking confirmation email. Please provide us with your Booking ID so that we can quickly address your concerns.

It is important to note that for each cancellation you initiate, you are required to compensate the amount equivalent to one night’s stay. This may also impact your Top Host status.
