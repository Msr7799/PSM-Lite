Agoda does not provide any legal advice. Hosts are responsible for learning and complying with short term rental rules in their area, although we recommend reading the following tips:

- Research relevant city laws regarding short term rentals
- Check with your city to see if you need a license to rent your property
- Some cities, counties and states require hosts to pay taxes on rental income, so you should contact your local government.
- If you have a timeshare, lease agreement, or your home is in a condo, contact your landlord to see if renting your home is allowed.
