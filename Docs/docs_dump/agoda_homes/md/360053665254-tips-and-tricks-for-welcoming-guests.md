Guests who choose to stay in Homes properties instead of hotels do so because Homes are cozy, personal, and unique in nature. Treat your guests well. A happy guest will leave you a good review and help you get more bookings in the future. Good reviews are an important decision-making factor for travelers. Here are some tips and tricks that will make your guests’ stay pleasant:

-
Communicate with your guests to inspire trust. We recommend that you reach out to your guests proactively once the booking has been confirmed and continue to stay in touch throughout their stay.
-
Provide clear check-in instructions to your guests. Travelers do not like uncertainty. Leave them detailed instructions on how to get into your property once they arrive.
-
Cleanliness is important. Keep your property sparkling clean. Tidy up the furniture, prepare the bathroom, clean and sanitize the floor and other surfaces. Your guests will appreciate that extra effort you put in to clean your property.
-
Add that personal touch. Some welcome goodies like a welcome basket of snacks could cheer up your guests after a long day on the road. If you are aware of your guests’ plans or itinerary, you may be able to put together some local recommendations for them.
