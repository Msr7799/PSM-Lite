If you need to modify your bank account details after it has been set up, you will need to send us two sets of documents: one set for your existing account and one set for your new account that you would like to add.

After you have added your new bank details on Host Manage, please send an email to biz@agoda.com with two sets of the following documents. Your email’s subject line should be: Bank Approval_[your property ID]_[your property name].

You can expect to hear back from us – either approving the bank account details or requesting additional documents – within 1-3 business days.

To modify your bank details, please go to the **Listings** page, click **Payment accounts** and then **VIEW ACCOUNT.**
