Currently you can only review guests within the Agoda app. This feature is not yet offered on the desktop browser version.

To review guests, follow these steps:


4. Respond to “How was your experience hosting?” with a thumbs up or thumbs down.


5. If you select the thumbs up, you’ll be asked why you liked the guest and can then enter a response.


6. If you select thumbs down, you’ll be asked the reason for your negative review and can

then enter a response.


7. Click 'Submit guest review' button to submit.
