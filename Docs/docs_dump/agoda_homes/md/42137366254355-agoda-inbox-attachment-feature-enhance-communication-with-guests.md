**What is the attachment feature?**

The attachment feature is now available in your Agoda Inbox, accessible only for confirmed bookings. This enables hosts and partners to share relevant information in image format, up to 10 MB per image. Guests can also share image attachments in the chat. The attachment feature is available on web and mobile app, directly though the Agoda Inbox feature.


**What are some example use-cases for the attachment feature?**

Attachments can be used to send check-in instructions, facilities schedules, directional maps, or other information to guests. In turn, guests can send copies of their passports or other relevant documents ahead of check-in. As a reminder, please do not send any sensitive information via attachments.


**Attachment feature details**

- Attachments can only be sent as an image file (.jpg or .png). If you would like to send another type of file, please convert the file online or take a screenshot.
- Only one image can be sent per message. If you need to send multiple images, please send them one at a time.
- Attachments sent by the host or property remain available in the guest chat for 14 days from the check-out date. After this period, they will be automatically removed and no longer accessible.
- In accordance with our Privacy Policy, image attachments may be reviewed, scanned, and analyzed. Please note, however, that hosts and properties are responsible for ensuring their own compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws when requesting and processing any attachments from guests sent through this feature.
