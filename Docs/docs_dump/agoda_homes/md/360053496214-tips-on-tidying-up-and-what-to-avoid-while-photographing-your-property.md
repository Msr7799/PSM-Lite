**Tips on tidying up bedrooms:**

-
Before you start shooting, make sure the clutter from the main bedroom is cleared. Cleaner scenes are less distracting to travelers and will make your space more welcoming.
-
Leave out unsightly objects. Make sure windows, mirrors and floors are spotless.
-
Turn off the television and hide any wires or cables.
-
Leave in the room only what’s available when guests arrive – for example, do not add items like flower arrangements, assortment of magazines, or items that is won’t be offered to guests.
-
Set the ambiance to reflect the energy of your place but don’t overdo it or the space would look unnatural.

It is important to have clean bathrooms. These details matter and should not be underestimated.
