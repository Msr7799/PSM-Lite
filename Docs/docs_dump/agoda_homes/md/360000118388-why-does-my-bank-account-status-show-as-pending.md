If your current payout method is selected as **Direct deposit to bank** and your bank account status is “pending,” it’s because the account has not been reviewed by our finance team yet.

Agoda finance will need to verify your bank account information before sending you a payout. This is to ensure we avoid sending money to the wrong account -- and we only need to verify it once. Once you have filled in your bank details, please provide supporting documents to help our Finance team to review your bank accounts by attaching documents in Host Manage.

**Documents required:**

A. For Personal bank account

B. For Corporate bank account

**Remark:**

If you would like to change bank account, please provide previous bank supporting document or contract/termination letter/ownership transfer between you and the previous owner or a document that shows linkage with the property.

You can expect to hear back from us – either approving the bank account details or requesting additional documents – within 2 business days.

If you have multiple properties, please make sure to set up bank account details for every property. If you do not receive any update from us regarding the verification of your bank account within 2-3 business days, please send a follow-up email to biz@agoda.com mentioning "Follow up - Bank Approval_[your property ID]_[your property name]” in the subject line. Please ensure that the title of your email is correct to avoid any delay.
