An Agoda Home is the entire accommodation listed by the property owner or the property manager who has the right to manage the owner’s property. Hosts do not stay on the property with guests.

**Multi-unit** properties: These are properties that have multiple allotments or multiple room choices available for guests to book. A property owner or manager needs to register and manage these properties through our YCS system.

**Single-unit** properties: These are properties with only one allotment. Only one booking may be facilitated in a single-unit property at any given point in time. Hosts need to register and manage these properties through our Host Manage system.
