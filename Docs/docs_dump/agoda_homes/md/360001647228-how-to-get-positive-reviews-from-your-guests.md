Good reviews can help you get more bookings. In addition to having a clean, welcoming and comfortable property, make sure you describe your home with detail and accuracy. Of course you’ll want to list all of your home’s good features, but we also recommend being as transparent as possible and not setting up false expectations. For example, you should mention if there are noisy bars or a construction site nearby. Some guests won’t mind, but all guests should get fair warning.

It’s very important to communicate with your guests. Doing so improves their experience and creates a sense of trust. We recommend staying in touch with guests before, during, and after their stay:

Remember, little details matter. You may want to leave a nice note, welcome basket, or a guide to local attractions and conveniences. If your guest is staying long-term, think of various ways to improve their stay.
