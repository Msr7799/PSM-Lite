Ready to list your property? Let’s get started by helping you create an Agoda Host Manage account.

Go to www.agoda.com/homes and click **CREATE ACCOUNT** in the top right. If you have previously booked a stay on agoda.com, you may sign in with the same email and password you used for your booking.

In order to use the host-mode app, you need to have the Agoda traveler app installed on your phone. Download the Agoda app from the App Store or Google Play Store.

Click **More** on the bottom right and **Sign in **with the same email and password as on your previous Agoda bookings. If you do not have an Agoda account, use **Create account **to register your name and email. Then, click **Sign up**. Click on **Host on Agoda Homes** to switch to the host-mode.
