Your calendar is an essential tool for effectively managing your prices and availability. With the ability to plan up to 365 days ahead, staying on top of your calendar helps avoid double bookings and boosts your opportunities for more reservations.

It updates automatically whenever you get a confirmed reservation or when changes are made in other linked calendars.

To tailor settings such as minimum stay, advance notice, and preparation time, consider reviewing __this__ helpful guide.


To manage the availability on the web after the property is live, go to the **Calendar **page and select the date range that you would like to adjust. Under Availability, select Available then put the price per night and click save. If you would like to close an allotment, select Blocked under Availability section and click save.
