As a valued partner, we believe it's crucial to keep you informed about Agoda’s operational changes on rate loading and commission changes that can directly impact our collaboration and mutual success. Therefore, we would like to provide more information on Reference Sell Rate loading and changes to commission and explain how these changes impact you.

Reference Sell Rate loading means that you load the reference rate that your property will be offered to the bookers. Agoda will collect from bookers, deduct its commission and remit the difference to you.

Note that there is no change in the amount the booker will pay and the amount that Agoda will remit to you, but instead of Agoda calculating the rate on your behalf taking into account Agoda commission, now the rate will be directly provided by you.

This means that you will receive the Reference Sell Rate that you have loaded minus Agoda commission and Tax on it (if applicable). We will remit the difference to you.

In addition, effective September 2023, we will deduct the following commission percentages from the total amount paid by bookers.


After the Reference Sell-rate loading apply, you can see applicable commission in the system by means:

go to Host Manage --> Booking & Earning --> View Commission

**How is the total amount calculated?**

Reference Sell Rate - % Commission - Tax* = Base Rate that you will receive

*If applicable Agoda will apply VAT/GST/sales tax on the commission charged to your property.

Tax = Commission x % Tax on commission


For example:

Below are sample calculations of the Base Rate received by property in Indonesia

Sample A : without promotion and rate channel setup

Sample B : with promotion and rate channel setup
