The price you set is the amount you’ll be paid, except in certain jurisdictions where additional taxes may apply. To determine a competitive price, research similar properties in your area. Consider factors like maximum occupancy, number of rooms, features, and nearby attractions.

Setting a fair and appealing price will help attract guests. When listing your property, consider pricing slightly below the local average to draw more interest. Don’t worry about starting low—you can always adjust your price later.


When listing your property on Agoda, you set the nightly rate on the **Pricing **step. This will be the price for the **Max guests allowed** you set on the **Basics** step. If you want to set rates for extra guests, you can adjust the occupancy and set the extra guest rate once your property is listed.

**Set the price yourself**


**Manage your nightly price with a channel manager**


You can manage your nightly price whenever you need on the Agoda extranet using the Pricing page or Calendar.
