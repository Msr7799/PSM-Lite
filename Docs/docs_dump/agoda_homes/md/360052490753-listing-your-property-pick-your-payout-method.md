When listing your property on Agoda, you’ll select your preferred payout method during the **Pricing **step. The two main options are bank transfer and PayPal. After your property is published, you’ll be asked to provide the necessary details to set up your account.

Payouts via Universal Payment Cards (UPC) are also available for merchant accounts. This method requires a credit card machine and allows you to charge the payout amount up to 150 days after the guest checks out. You can contact us if you’d like to request this option.


**Changing your payout method**

If you wish to change your payout method after your property is listed, you can contact us for assistance. Keep in mind that all payout details will go through fraud checks before they’re approved.


**About your first payout**

The first payout you receive will be available 30 days after your first guest checks out. You can learn more about the 30-day payout window here.
