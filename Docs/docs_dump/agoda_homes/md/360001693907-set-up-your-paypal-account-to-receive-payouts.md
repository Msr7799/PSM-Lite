If you have selected PayPal as your payout method, you can set up your account under **Payout accounts** in the Agoda extranet. Before adding your PayPal account, please ensure that it matches the currency you use on the extranet. If you would like to change this currency, please contact us.

Please note that Agoda supports only 22 currencies available on PayPal. If your PayPal account currency differs from your property’s currency on the extranet, currency exchange rates will apply to all transactions.

Lastly, please be aware that PayPal accounts registered under PayPal (Thailand) Co., Ltd. cannot be used to receive payments from Agoda.
