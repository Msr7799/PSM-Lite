The license number is a 10 digit number assigned by local authorities to each individual listing you register.

**Q: ****What will happen to my reservations if my listing is unlisted due to being unlicensed?**

Unlicensed properties in Japan may be found in violation of the Hotel Business Act, and Agoda has a policy of unlisting unlicensed properties. While bookings are not automatically canceled for unlisted properties, we reserve the right to cancel reservations for any unlicensed property. This may result in being fined according to the penalty policies outlined in your contract with Agoda. Please apply for the license as soon as possible and add the licensing number and other relevant information to your listings.


**Q: If my listing is unlisted, will Agoda automatically cancel my reservations? Should hosts cancel on their own?**

**Q: Will I still be able to access payment page if my property is unlisted?**

Yes. As long as your account is not deleted, you can still access your payment page and receive any payable funds.
