Please call us as well as the other booking site immediately so that we can find alternate accommodations as quickly and gracefully as possible. The customer service number is provided in the booking confirmation voucher email. Do not attempt to relocate guest(s) on your own. Keep in mind that this is a stressful situation for everyone and it’s crucial to be as kind and understanding as possible with the guests. It’s not the guests’ fault. The important thing is to resolve the situation.

To help prevent double bookings, we recommend logging into your Agoda account and any other booking services you use every day. It’s also a good idea to use our Calendar Sync feature and/or switch from Instant Book to Book on Request. If you use Channel Manager software to manage your bookings across different platforms, please check your settings. Channel Managers may at times incorrectly mark your properties as available after they have already been booked.
