**EasyCancel** feature allows properties to offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before check-in on all existing bookings and future bookings.

At Agoda, our guests and hosts are our top priority. With the ongoing COVID -19 crisis, every part of the travel industry has been deeply impacted and taken toll on millions of travelers globally. Our primary concern right now is ensuring the safety of our guests and hosts.

We are committed to supporting your business by attracting guests who are still able to travel. Our data indicates a willing segment of travelers who are looking to book, but are reluctant because of uncertainty around future travel restrictions. To appeal to these bookers, we have created a new promotional product, Agoda EasyCancel. It simply assures travelers that all current and future bookings come with a 24-hour cancellation policy.

Enrolled properties receive the Agoda EasyCancel badge on their property page.
