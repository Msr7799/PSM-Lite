Pricing is the most important factor for guests when they are looking for accommodation. In addition to setting a competitive nightly price for your property, we encourage you to utilize our wide range of promotional discounts to make your property more attractive. Unlike channel discounts which are user-specific, promotional discounts are available to all potential guests.

To set up attractive promotions, you may select any of the available templates below or apply a custom promotion.

**Early Bird/Adv****ance**** Purchase**: This helps secure bookings early, typically 30-90 days before guest arrival.

**Last Minute****:** Run some last-minute promotions to appeal to late bookers or to attract a booking when a guest cancels at the last minute. With this promotion, guests get a discount if they book within a few days (typically 7) of arrival.

**72-****H****our**** Promotion**: This limited time offer is best utilized when you want to secure bookings within a short period of time. This promotion creates a sense of urgency for the guest towards a property that may be in high demand.

**Weekend Getaway****:** This promotion allows you to encourage full weekend bookings, perfect for guests looking for weekend getaways.

**First 3 Guests Promotion: **This promotion allows your first three guests to receive a steep 33% discount on your newly registered property. Such a discount increases the possibility of your property getting booked quickly. With the first few bookings, your property will start ranking higher on our search page. Also, a good guest experience during these stays will increase your chances of receiving great reviews, meaning a higher possibility of subsequent bookings.

**Long Stays**: We encourage you to provide steep discounts for long stays as a long booking can often be more lucrative than multiple short bookings.

**After****-****Hours Promotion****:** By default, this promotion may be used between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM (property’s local time), but it may be adjusted if you require.

**Express Tonight**: This promotion allows for immediate bookings, and you may choose to have the guest stay the same night, next day or day after.

**China Only**: This promotion is available for guests who browse Agoda in Mandarin or search from Greater China origins.

**Free Night**: This is a catchy promotion for guests looking for freebies.

Unable to find something that fits your requirements? Use the **Customized Promotion** template to create your own. This basic template allows you to select range of booking dates, stay dates, and a discount that can be either a percentage, fixed amount, or free nights.
