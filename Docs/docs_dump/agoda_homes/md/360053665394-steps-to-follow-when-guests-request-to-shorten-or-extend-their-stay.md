If a guest contacts you to request for a change in the booking such as extending or shortening the duration of stay, rescheduling, or cancelling, please reach out to us. You may also let the guest know that they can reach out to us directly to request these changes.

To notify us, please send an email to biz@agoda.com or contact us. Provide the Booking ID so that we can assist you accordingly.
