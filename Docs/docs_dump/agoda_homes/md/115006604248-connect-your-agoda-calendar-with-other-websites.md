Connecting your calendars across all the websites where you list your property can easily help you prevent overbookings. In the Agoda extranet, you can fully connect your calendars by exporting your Agoda calendar to other websites and importing their calendar. This way, when your property is booked on one site, the dates will automatically be blocked on the other.

###
**Fully connect the Agoda calendar with other websites** ** **

**Desktop and Agoda app **

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from Listings.
- Go to
**Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.
- Click
**Connect calendars**.
- For the website you want to connect calendars with:
- Copy your Agoda calendar link and paste it into the calendar connection feature of the other website.
- Get the calendar link of the other website and paste it into the
*Other website link* field.
- Name the calendar and click
**Import**.

- Repeat the process for the other websites you want to connect with.

**Managing calendar connections**

You can view and manage your calendar connections at any time in the Agoda extranet by navigating to **Calendar** >> **Calendar connections**.

**Edit or remove a calendar connection** ** **

**Desktop and Agoda app **
