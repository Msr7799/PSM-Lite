You can customize how guests book your property under **Rates and availability >>** **Booking settings** in the Agoda extranet to fit your hosting style and ensure a smooth experience for both you and your guests. From this page, you can select your preferred booking process, set your cancellation policy, limit when guests can book, and determine the required lengths of stay. Once you make any changes, be sure to review them and then click **Save**.


Your property will be able to accept bookings from guests instantly once it is live on Agoda. You can change this in **Booking settings** to **Request to book** if you want to review bookings before they are confirmed. Learn more about Request to book here.

The cancellation policy you set will apply to all the bookings you receive. You can change your policy at any time by simply selecting the one you want and then clicking **Save**. Learn more about cancellation policies here.

Set the maximum number of days that guests can make a reservation in advance. This gives you more control over your calendar, helps you stay flexible for personal plans or property maintenance, and lets you adjust pricing or availability as needed.

Set the minimum number of days between when a guest books and their check-in date. This requirement gives you enough time to prepare your property, coordinate cleaning or maintenance, and manage your schedule.


Control how long guests can stay at your property by setting minimum and maximum length of stay requirements. You can apply these rules to all bookings or set stay date conditions for specific dates to optimize your calendar and ensure your property is booked just the way you want.
