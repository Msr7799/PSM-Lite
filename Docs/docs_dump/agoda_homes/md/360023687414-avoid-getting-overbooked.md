Getting overbooked is always a possibility if you are listing your property across multiple platforms. But when you cancel one booking over another, it will most certainly create an unpleasant experience for your guests. Here are some tips on how to avoid getting overbooked:

Do not panic if your property gets overbooked! Contact the guests to reconfirm their arrival details. Then analyze the bookings to determine who to relocate or cancel. The last received booking is not always the best one to change. Consider the rates, agreements, possible penalties from partners, length of stay, or any other factors associated with each booking and then take the best call.

If you choose to relocate guests who made their booking on Agoda, immediately contact the Agoda Hotline indicated on the booking confirmation email. Please provide us with your Booking ID so that we can assist you promptly.
