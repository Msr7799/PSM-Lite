It’s very important to keep your price up to date, where you, as the host, loaded your nightly sell rates into the calendar, and the system automatically deducts the applicable commission from those rates and this is what you get paid, unless subject to additional taxes in certain jurisdictions.

The commission you pay to Agoda is automatically deducted from the rates you input into the system. This means that the rate displayed to guests already includes the commission, ensuring transparency and simplifying the booking process.Commission rates may vary depending on property location, it’s essential to review and understand the specific commission rate applicable to your property.

In some jurisdictions, additional taxes or fees may apply to the commission you pay to Agoda. These taxes can vary significantly based on local regulations and can include value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST), or other similar levies.
