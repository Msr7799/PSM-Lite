Once your bank account request has been reviewed, our Finance team will reach out to you to provide more details that are specific to your case. These emails will be sent from Biz@agoda.com. Please check your Inbox and Junk Folder for any communications from Agoda.

Please note that you should not modify your existing bank account submission request. If you cancel the request and create a new submission, this will revert to “new” status and approval may take an additional 5 business days.

**What are some common reasons for rejection?**

Roman/Latin alphabet and numeric characters (0-9) can be accepted, while special characters are not allowed (i.e. = , ! “ $ % & : * < > ; , # { } [ ] \ _ ^ | ~ @). If your bank account details and/or address contain the “&” (ampersand) please replace “&” with “and”.
