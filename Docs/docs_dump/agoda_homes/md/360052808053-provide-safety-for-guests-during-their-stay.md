Accommodation providers are always having to adapt to changes in the travel industry, and so too are guests. Putting measures in place to enhance your cleaning and ensuring safe interactions with guests will go a long way towards giving them the comfort and peace of mind they need to book a stay at your property. Here are some things you can do to accommodate guests so that they feel safe and secure:

**Contactless check-in and check-out:** Offer contactless check-in and check-out such as a key lockbox or electronic lock to better ensure social distancing. If you have contactless check-in and check-out or plan to offer it at your accommodation, make sure to update your property information and check-in details so guests are informed of the safe environment you are creating.

**Social distancing**: Practice physical distancing if face-to-face interaction with guests is necessary. Instead of a handshake, opt for forms of greetings that do not involve physical contact. Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter when interacting with guests and absolutely avoid any interactions if you are showing any symptoms of sickness.

**Provide cleaning supplies for your guests**: Empower your guests by setting out cleaning supplies they can use. Guests feel more comfortable if they can clean on their own during their stay. Some key items to stock up on are disposable paper towels, multi-surface cleaner, and disinfectant wipes or sprays.

**Provide a reminder about your cleanliness efforts: **Reassure guests by placing a reminder in your welcome booklet or on a desk in the common area informing guests of the following: *This property has been properly cleaned and sanitized for your arrival.*

**Provide protective equipment and supplies for guests**: Providing protective equipment for guests show you care about their personal safety. Small gestures such as leaving antibacterial hand sanitizer, reusable face masks, disposable gloves, and extra hand soap could go a long way.

**Remove shoes when entering the house**: Asks guests to remove their shoes when stepping into indoor areas of the accommodation to avoid dirt and germs from entering the house from outside.

**Educate guests on safe practices**: Inform guests how they can contribute to preventing the spread of germs and what actions they should take if they identify symptoms based on WHO guidelines. Provide a list of local emergency numbers and other important contact information.
