Agoda is Asia’s largest online travel agency that caters to more than 2 million travelers who visit our website and app every day. We are committed to providing quality stays in over 5 million properties and accommodation types ranging from hotels and resorts to apartments, homes, and villas.

While we have always had non-hotel accommodation available on our platform, the changing market demands more emphasis and focus on increasing supply and elevating quality. Agoda Homes – a core business line within Agoda – was born from this demand.

An Agoda Homes property is an entire apartment, bungalow, house, or villa listed by you: the property owner or property manager. Unlike other OTA platforms, all Agoda Homes are for the entire accommodation, which means the host does not stay on the property with their guests. The host simply facilitates check-in and check-out, provides local recommendations, and ensures a quality stay for guests.

On Agoda Homes, we support a wide range of accommodation types, including serviced apartments, homes, private villas, farm stays, chalets, boats, and many more.
