Agoda is committed to providing the best travel experience to our guest and guarantees that they will be able to stay at the property they booked. Therefore, when you are unable to honor our booking, it not only harms our reputation, but it also creates a bad guest experience.

Under an unusual circumstance where you are unable to honor our booking and accommodate the guest at your property, this is considered booking rejection as stated in Agoda’s Terms and Conditions . You will be responsible to provide and prepay suitable alternate accommodation for our guest, including a private transfer at no extra cost. We recommend contacting your guest in advance to inform them of these arrangements via our Messaging System.

In the event that no alternative is available, you may contact** the Agoda Hotline for assistance **and,** based on ****Agoda’s Terms and Conditions section 14.4**, for each Booking that you fail to honor, you shall compensate Agoda an amount equivalent to one night's average nightly value of the Booking if you accommodate the Guest at your property or two nights' average nightly value if you relocate the Guest. This cost will be charged to your property later, depending on the payment method used by your property. This will normally be reflected as ‘**Adjusted Transaction**’ under your Transaction Page.

You can reach the Agoda Hotline team through the Contact us button and select **Booking related** and **Cannot honor Agoda booking**. If you have urgent booking-related issues, call us at the Agoda Hotel Hotline in your country as soon as possible.

In order to prevent future booking rejections, we recommend the following approach:

Close out your calendar allotment and availability to avoid receiving future bookings. Check if you have any upcoming bookings. If yes, please reach out to guests to inform them of the latest regulations and follow the above process. |
