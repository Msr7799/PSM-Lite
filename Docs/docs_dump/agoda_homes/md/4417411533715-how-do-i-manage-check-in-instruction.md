We recently added a field in host manage for providing exact check-in instructions. Did you know that hosts who provide specific check-in instructions have a 16% lower cancellation rate?


Just add your property’s check-in guide through link below:

__Update on web__

To manage check-in instruction on the web after the property is live, go to the **Description **page and provide the information on box “**provide exact check-in instructions**” and click save.

Note: How to get there is intended to tell guests how to get from the airport or a major transport station to your Agoda Home. Exact check-in instructions are intended to tell guests how they get into the property (i.e., receive keys or door code)


__Update on App__

To manage check-in instruction on the app after the property is live, go to the **Listing, tap your property, tap check-in instruction** and provide the information on box “**check-in instructions**” and click save.
