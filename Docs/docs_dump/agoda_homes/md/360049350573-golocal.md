With COVID-19 restrictions slowly being relaxed, we are seeing some return of domestic travelers ready to explore and eager to escape weeks of isolation and quarantine.

Agoda is launching a multi- platform marketing campaign to capture this trend and generate more demand and bookings from travelers within your country. A new, exclusive Agoda GoLocal site dedicated to domestic travelers with a series of exciting marketing initiatives will include:

“**GoLocal**” simply offers domestic customers in your country an additional 10% discount on existing rate channels or 20% discount in total.

Enrolled properties receive the GoLocal badge on their property page.




Interested? To enroll your property on GoLocal, reach out to our Support team by clicking on the **Support** button on Host Manage.
