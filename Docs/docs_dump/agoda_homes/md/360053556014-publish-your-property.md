After publishing, it may take up to 48 hours for the property to go live on our platform. During this time, we conduct a fraud review to ensure a safe experience for our guests. While in review, your property status will be listed as Publishing on the **Listings **page. You will receive an email notification on the review results within 48 hours.

Note: If you are using a Channel manager, you will receive an email notification from us to map the property on your channel manager's system once the property has been created.
