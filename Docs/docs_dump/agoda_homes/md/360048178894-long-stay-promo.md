During a global crisis such as Covid-19, we understand that your business may have been heavily impacted due to travel restrictions and border-control measures. With frequent changes in travel policies around the world, we have compiled the latest for you to stay updated on whether your guests will eventually be allowed to check-in at your property. As the accommodation policies are also rapidly changing, we recommend you follow closely your local government's advice and manage your property/s on Host Manage accordingly. It is important that you are compliant with the local regulations and have full knowledge of whether you can/are allowed to accept guests at your property.

In the event that you are able to accept guests, Agoda Homes has great deals that you can enroll your properties on to maximize your property’s booking potential! Your property could offer space for self-isolation or help stranded travelers.

This new promotion allows properties to offer 40% discount on stays with minimum 14-day duration till August 31, 2020 to support guests during the current crisis.

Enrolled properties receive this badge on their property page.

There are also customer-marketing efforts in place to make your property (and the promotion) more discoverable to our guests who are looking to book.

Interested? Should you agree to enroll your property on this promotion, you can simply follow one of the options below!
