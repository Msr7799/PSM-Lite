We are excited to announce the launch of the Bank Account Cloning Feature on Host Manage. If you need to collect revenue from Agoda by Telegraphic Transfer (direct deposit to bank), this feature streamlines your bank account setup process, and saves you valuable time.

Here’s how Bank Account Cloning feature works:

Step 1: Access your Host Manage account and choose the Payment Accounts tab from one of your properties.

Step 2: Locate and click the button “Select Payment Method.”

Step 3: Select which of the approved bank accounts you want to apply to **all** properties, and click “Confirm.”

Step 4: Once the cloning is done, you will see a successful notification on the screen.


Step 1: Access your Host Manage account and choose the Payment Accounts tab from one of your properties.

Step 2: Locate and click the button marked “View Account.”

Step 3: You will be directed to the bank account setup page. Click the “Create” button to proceed.

Step 4: Fill in required information (varies by country) and upload your bank account supporting documentation on the bottom right.

For detailed instructions of bank account setup, please refer to: How do I Set Up my Bank Account? - Agoda Partner Hub

Step 5: Wait for the Agoda Finance team to review your bank accounts.

If the status shows “Pending” for more than 5 business days, please send a follow-up email to biz@agoda.com, mentioning "Follow up" in your email subject line. If the status changes to “Rejected,” the Finance team will reach out to you with the rejection reason by email. Once your bank account status is changed to “Approved” you can move on to the next step.

Step 6: Follow Step. 1~Step.4 in the section “**If you already have some properties with approved bank:”**


Note: Now we can replicate an approved bank account to all your properties! If you want to collect payment by multiple bank accounts, please set up an approved bank account for one of the respective properties and contact Agoda Service Team to support bank account cloning.
