If you wish to change the preferred payout method after your property is live, please **Contact Us**. Our Partner Support Specialist will get back to you within 1-3 business days.

Please note that the new payout conditions will apply only for future bookings. Please let our Partner Support Specialist know if you are unable to process payment for any existing booking using the old payout conditions.
