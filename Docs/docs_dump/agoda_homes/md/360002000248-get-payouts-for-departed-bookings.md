Payouts for your bookings are made available within three days after the guest checks out. You can claim these by approving payable bookings on the Earnings page.

**Desktop and Agoda app**

Approved payouts will be sent to you through the method you have set up, typically taking 3-5 business days. You may also enable Auto-pay to automatically initiate payout once your conditions are met.


**What to do when amount receivable is negative**

On rare occasions, the amount receivable may be negative. This is usually due to a charge for rejecting a confirmed booking and failing to relocate the guest. You can see these charges under **Adjustments** on the **Earnings** page. In the case you see these charges and have questions, please reach out to us.


**Find the payout date for a booking**

You can see when a booking will be payable under the **Pending **tab of the **Earnings **page.
