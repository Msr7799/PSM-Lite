All hosts in Japan require a license in order to rent out their properties. For properties in Japan to be live on Agoda, we need the property’s license number - a 10-digit number assigned by local authorities to each individual property you wish to rent out. To apply, visit Japan Tourism Agency’s portal website.

Any unlicensed property in Japan has been deactivated since June 15, 2018. A deactivated property does not mean a deleted account. As long as your account is still active on Agoda, you may access your profile to manage your payments and settings.

Any booking for un-licensed properties in Japan with a check-in date on or after June 15, 2018 must be canceled to comply with the country’s regulations. To stay up to date on any rules and regulations, we recommend you visit the Japan Tourism Agency’s website.

If your property has been impacted, you will not be able to receive any bookings. If you wish to reactivate your property, contact us and provide your license number.

Note: Do not intentionally enter false information. Doing so may lead to penalties from national and local regulations. License information provided by you will be displayed on your property page on Agoda and will be subject to inspection by the regulators. Agoda reserves the right to deactivate any property that is found to have missing or false license information.

You may also add the license number yourself on Host Manage. Go to the **Listings **page. Click **Edit listing** and select **Rental License** under **Legal**. Provide your license type, number, full legal name, email address, property address, and room number. Save your changes.
