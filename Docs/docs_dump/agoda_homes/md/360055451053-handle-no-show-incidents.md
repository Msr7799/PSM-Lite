A no-show incident is where a confirmed guest does not arrive at your property and does not contact you or Agoda prior to explain their change of plans. If you face a no-show from any of your guests, the cancellation policy you have set for your property will apply.

To report a no-show, please email us at biz@agoda.com or contact us. Provide the Booking ID so that we can take care of your request promptly.
