It is important to ensure you and your cleaning staff are safe and protected by taking all necessary precautions before cleaning. It is also important to know which supplies to stock up on and how to properly use them for your safety and the most effective clean. There are a few simple steps you should take to prepare for your cleaning session.

**Wait before entering your accommodation**: According to WHO, airborne respiratory droplets can last up to three hours. It’s important to note that scientific research is still unclear about how long smaller aerosol particles, such as COVID-19, can last in the air. If possible, it is highly recommended to wait 24 hours before entering your property. If you are unable to wait 24 hours, a minimum waiting time of 3 hours is advised as most airborne droplets would have settled by then.

**Air out the accommodation after entering**: Once you enter the property, open all doors and windows to increase the air circulation of your space.

**Wear personal protective equipment**: Put on proper protective equipment before entering the property and wear it throughout the cleaning session. This can reduce your risk of exposure to germs and chemicals. All cleaning staff should use the following equipment:

**Wash hands regularly**: All cleaners should wash their hands regularly throughout the cleaning process. This includes when they have the gloves on as well as when the gloves are removed. Make sure to wash hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. When handwashing is not possible, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. ** **

**Avoid touching your face while cleaning**: All cleaners should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth while cleaning.

**Use approved products**: Be sure that only approved sanitizing products are used during your cleaning session. You can refer to relevant agencies for a list of approved cleaners and disinfectants. According to WHO, products with a 70% alcohol solution or products with a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 0.1% are suitable for disinfectant products. Some commonly approved products that you may already have include:

**Read and follow instruction labels on cleaning products: **Always follow the directions on cleaning product and disinfectant labels, including how to use the product, dilution concentration, and contact time. If contact time or concentration is lower than recommended, this will hinder the effectiveness of the cleaning solution or disinfectant. However, if the chemical concentration is higher than recommended, surfaces being cleaned may be damaged.

**Check products and continuously restock:** Keep a checklist of all products needed for cleaning as well as their expiry dates. Use this checklist to determine if any items need to be restocked or replaced. Cleaning products that are past their expiration date may be less effective or ineffective at killing germs.

**Store solutions properly:** Use opaque containers to store your cleaning solutions and keep them in a covered area that is not in direct sunlight. If using chlorine solutions, prepare it daily to ensure the correct concentration is maintained.

**Do not mix cleaning solutions:** Avoid combining different product solutions as this may cause dangerous chemical reactions.
