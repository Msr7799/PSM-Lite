The e-Card is a physical credit card that Agoda provides to you for charging all eligible bookings. Like any other credit card, the Agoda e-Card can be swiped at any POS terminal as long as the terminal is under the 7011 merchant category code (MCC for Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, or Central Reservation Services businesses).

Once you receive your e-Card from us, along with instructions on how to use it, please confirm receipt by **Contacting Us**. The e-Card has no value in it until booking transactions are made. Your e-Card will also have an expiry date, so please make sure to check and only submit payment before its expiry.

Payments will be available to process up to 150 days after check-out. However, we recommend processing payments as soon as possible. Please also ensure that charges are processed in the same currency as the booking in order to avoid undercharging or overcharging.

Please **Contact Us** if you wish to set up the e-Card as your property’s preferred payout method.
