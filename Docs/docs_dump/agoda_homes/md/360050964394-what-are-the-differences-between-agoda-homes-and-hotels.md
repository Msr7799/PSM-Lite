Hotels are established, professionally managed accommodations that allow paid lodging on a short-term basis. Typically, hotels have many rooms with a wide range of pricing to meet various guest requirements. In many aspects, the multi-unit Homes properties (especially the serviced apartments) function similarly to hotels.

Agoda Homes are much more personal and unique in nature. These accommodations are managed by hosts who want their guests to have a quality stay at an affordable price while offering an enjoyable local experience for guests. Agoda Homes are especially great for large groups, allowing guests to maintain their privacy and refrain from sharing common facilities with other guests.

On the Agoda platform, a hotel uses yellow star ratings. An Agoda Homes property will display an **Agoda Homes** badge and uses pink star ratings.
