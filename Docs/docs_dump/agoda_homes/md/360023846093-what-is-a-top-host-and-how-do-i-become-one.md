Top hosts meet several criteria that establish them as reliable hosts who routinely provide a high quality experience to their guests. To become a top host, you must already be a verified host, have 5 completed and departed bookings, an average review score of 7.5 or above, a response rate over 70%, and no more than two bad cancellations over a six month period. A bad cancellation occurs when a host cancels a guest’s reservation. Top hosts receive more bookings, so it’s worth making the effort to get this status.
