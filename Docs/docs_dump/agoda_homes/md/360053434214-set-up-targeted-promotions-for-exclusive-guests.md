Pricing is the most important factor for guests when they are looking for accommodation. In addition to setting a competitive nightly price for your property, we encourage you to utilize our wide range of Targeted promotions to make your property more attractive.

Targeted promotions are user-specific discounts that are not publicly available to all travelers, but only to those who meet the promotion criteria. We usually boost rankings of properties offering a Targeted promotion on our search page, making them more discover-able. These properties have also benefited from increased bookings and lower cancellations. Agoda supports a range of Targeted promotions from which you can choose:

-
**Private Sale:** Exclusive discount for travelers logged on to their Agoda accounts while making bookings. The discounts appear as **Insider Deals!** on our search and property pages. Based on historical data, the likelihood of getting bookings increases by 3x if your property is enrolled in this channel.
-
**VIP**** Gold**: Exclusive for Agoda VIP travelers who have chosen Agoda as their preferred accommodation provider. These travelers are also more likely to book properties from us.
-
**Mobile**: Exclusive price for travelers browsing and making bookings via our mobile application.
-
**Domestic **and GoLocal: New channel to tap into domestic demand as markets recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.
-
**China**: Exclusive for Chinese travelers.
-
**Package**: For travelers booking both a flight and hotel together.
-
**Retail: **This is the default channel for properties to be featured on Agoda. There is no discount associated with this channel.

All activated Targeted promotion will stack with any existing promotion. This helps us make sure that our customers are always getting the best deals.

If you would like to enroll your property on any of our channels, please contact us.
