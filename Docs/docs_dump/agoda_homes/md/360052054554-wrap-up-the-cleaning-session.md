Once your property has been properly cleaned and sanitized, you’ll be ready to throw out and store your cleaning supplies. Follow these instructions to wrap up your cleaning session in a way that avoids cross contamination:

**Wash your hands**: All cleaners should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water as soon as they remove their gloves. If this is not possible, use a hand sanitizing solution with 60% alcohol content. Remember to do this before going about your normal daily routine.

**Safely dispose of non-reusable cleaning supplies or personal protective equipment: **Throw away disposable products such as disinfectant wipes or sponges.

**Clean and sanitize any reusable cleaning supplies: **Avoid cross-contamination by emptying and sanitizing the vacuum and sanitizing tools such as brooms or mops between each property or cleaning session. Wash any cleaning cloths at the highest heat setting appropriate for the material.

**Clean and sanitize reusable personal protective equipment**: Wash any goggles or face shields with soap and warm water and spray with disinfectant spray. Reusable face masks should be washed at the highest heat setting appropriate for the material.

**Check and restock cleaning supplies as needed**: Check the stock and expiry dates of your cleaning supplies and replace anything as needed. Have a list of all supplies that are used so it is easy for you to keep inventory and refill when needed. This list should also include any supplies you leave for guests during their stay.
