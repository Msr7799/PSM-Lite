### How Arrival guide and house rules are used

-
**Check-in and check-out times:** Displayed on your Agoda page under Some helpful facts. This helps guests see when they can check in and check out, giving them the clarity they need to finalize their booking decisions.
-
**Check-in instructions:** These details are sent to guests a few days before their check-in date. Providing clear, step-by-step instructions ensures a smooth arrival and reduces guest anxiety about the check-in process.
-
**Directions:** Once a booking is confirmed, your directions are automatically sent to guests. This is key to helping them find your property easily, improving their first impression and ensuring they feel comfortable getting there without any confusion.
-
**Parking:** Parking information is displayed directly on your Agoda page, giving guests confidence that they’ll have a place to park upon arrival, which can be a deciding factor for those with cars.
-
**House rules:** House rules will be displayed on your Agoda page under Policies, helping guests understand your property's expectations and guidelines before booking.

### Tips for your Arrival guide and house rules

Setting up your Arrival guide and house rules is essential for ensuring a smooth guest experience and clear communication. Here are some practical tips to help you input these details effectively and understand their impact:

**House rules**

House rules are your opportunity to set expectations for guests during their stay. They should be simple, clear, and easy to follow. Here’s how to create effective house rules:

-
-
**Be concise and straightforward.** Avoid overly complex or specific rules that may confuse guests. Aim for 8-10 items to keep the list manageable and appealing.
-
**Focus on essentials.** Include rules about pets, smoking, quiet hours, and any fees for rule violations.
-
**Inform guests early.** While additional rules can be shared during check-in or through a guest book, it’s best to communicate key rules before booking to avoid surprises.
-
**Recommended length:** Write at least 100 words to show you care about your property and guests.


Examples of common house rules:

*Only registered guests are allowed.*
*Smoking or pets are not allowed.*
*Events or parties are not allowed.*
*Quiet time is after 11:00 PM.*
*Please dispose of all garbage in the trash can.*
*Turn off lights or AC/Heater when not in use.*
*If you break or damage something, please let us know for replacement or repair.*

**Directions to your property**

Clear directions are key to ensuring guests can easily find your property. Include the following:

-
**Transportation options:** Provide details on how guests can reach your property from nearby airports, train stations, or bus terminals. Highlight the easiest and most convenient options.
-
**Step-by-step instructions:** Include journey times, estimated costs, and instructions for entering your property (e.g., main entrance, passcode, key box).
-
**Landmarks:** Mention nearby landmarks or signs to help guests navigate.
-
**Contact information:** Provide primary and secondary contact details for assistance.
-
**Check-in outside normal hours:** Include instructions for late or early check-ins, along with any additional charges.

Example template:

The fastest way to reach our apartment is by taxi, which takes 30 minutes from [Airport Name]. Taxi fare is approximately $70.


Alternatively, you may take Bus 100 from [Airport Name] to [Bus Stop Name], which departs every hour between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM. Bus fare is $25, and the journey takes about 1 hour. From [Bus Stop Name], you can walk 10 minutes to our apartment, located opposite [Landmark Name].


If you have trouble finding the property, contact us at [Phone Number].

**Check-in instructions**

Providing clear check-in instructions reduces guest uncertainty and enhances their experience. Include:

- Entry details: Explain how guests can access your property (e.g., self-check-in, reception, or meeting staff).
- Key collection: Share door codes, lock-box codes, or contact details for key collection.
- Additional charges: Mention any fees for early or late check-ins to avoid surprises.

### Managing details across Arrival guide and Description pages

Details like check-in instructions and directions can be added to either the Arrival guide or the Description page. Changes made in one will automatically sync to the other, ensuring consistency. To streamline your setup, we recommend using the Arrival guide, as it is the most up-to-date tool for managing this information.
