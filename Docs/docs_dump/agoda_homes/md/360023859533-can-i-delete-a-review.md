You can respond to reviews **but you cannot delete them**. This policy maintains transparency. Additionally, it’s instructive for you as a host to read guest reviews to identify what guests enjoy about your home as well as areas where there’s room for improvement. If you feel that the review is inaccurate, you may wish to respond, but remember to be gracious and polite.
