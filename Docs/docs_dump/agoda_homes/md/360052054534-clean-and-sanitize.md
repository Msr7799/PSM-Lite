Cleaning is the removal of dirt, germs, and other impurities from surfaces or objects. Sanitizing is the process of killing germs on surfaces and objects using chemicals or disinfectants. The CDC recommends both cleaning and sanitizing using household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants in order to reduce any risk of spreading diseases, including COVID-19.

Here are some general cleaning instructions you should keep in mind for each room of the house.

**Order of cleaning**: Begin cleaning in the cleanest areas and progress to the dirtiest areas. In each room, start from higher to lower levels as debris may fall on the floor.

**Garbage removal:** Before cleaning in any room, remove all garbage or items left behind by the previous guests.

**Wash linens**: To prevent the spread of germs, avoid shaking dirty linens and place them directly in a laundry bag when transferring them to the washing machine. Wash all linens or textiles at the highest heat setting recommended for the fabric.

**Cleaning hard surfaces and floors:** Clean all surfaces, including shelves and hard floors. Start dusting or sweeping higher surfaces and work your way down. After dusting or sweeping, clean the surfaces with multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth. For floors, you may use a mop and floor cleaning solution. Be sure to routinely clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

**Cleaning soft surfaces**: Vacuum any soft surfaces that cannot be put in the laundry such as carpeting, rugs, or upholstery. Make sure to also vacuum soft furniture such as the sofa. Clean any stains with a brush, soap, and warm water or in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

**Sanitize all surfaces:** Keep germs at bay by wiping all surfaces with disinfectant. To be effective, sanitization usually requires the disinfectant to wet the surface for at least one minute. Be sure to read the label on your products and follow all instructions.

Common areas, such as living and dining rooms, are places where guests and family members spend most of their time with each other. Before you clean, start tidying up by removing any clutter. Follow the steps below when cleaning the common areas:

**Empty all garbage cans:** Remove all items left behind by previous guests. Reline all empty cans with new garbage bags.

**Wash and clean all linens**: Using a high heat setting, wash your linens and other textiles such as throw pillow covers, curtains, and dining room linens. Pillows, duvets, throws, and cushions that cannot be put in the laundry should be sprayed with disinfectant. To minimize the spread of dust and germs through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

**Collect and clean all objects on surfaces: **Wipe items such as lamps or decor with a microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or dust and use a multi-surface cleaner to remove any residue. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. For hard to reach places such as ceiling fans or high shelves, use an extendable duster. Start from the highest surfaces and work your way to the bottom.

**Spray or wipe high-touch areas with disinfectant**: Spray all high-touch areas such as doorknobs, blinds, keys or electronic keypads, light switches, remote controls, tabletops, and shelving with disinfectant and wipe with a microfiber cloth or wipe with disinfectant wipes and leave to dry.

**Vacuum soft surfaces**: Vacuum all soft items such as rugs and carpeted areas as well as other furniture with textile surfaces. Spot clean textiles using a water and detergent solution and a bristle brush. To clean furniture made of leather, you can use special cleaning fluid to avoid damaging the texture of the material.

**Clean the floor**: Sweep all non-carpeted areas, then mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution. Pay extra attention to corners and sides of the walls. When cleaning the floor using a vacuum or by sweeping, make sure to get areas under the sofa or large furniture. Spot clean any stains with a brush, a detergent solution, and warm water if needed.

**Clean windows and glass**: Working from the highest point to the lowest, clean all windows and glass with a glass cleaner spray and microfiber towel.

Bedrooms are resting areas for guests and one of the most important places to clean. Most items in the bedroom come in close contact with a person’s skin. These items must be in pristine condition – no signs of worn spots, tears, or stains. Follow the steps below when cleaning the bedroom:

**Empty all garbage cans:** Remove all items left behind by previous guests. Reline all empty cans with new garbage bags.

**Wash all linens**: Using a high heat setting, wash your linens and other textiles such as throw pillow covers, curtains, and dining room linens. Pillows, duvets, throws, and cushions that cannot be put in the laundry should be sprayed with disinfectant. To minimize the spread of dust and germs through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

**Clean the mattress:** Clean your mattress using a disinfectant spray. Spray the solution in a sweeping motion to cover the entire surface, then let it completely dry before using the mattress or putting on the laundered sheets.

**Collect and clean all objects on surfaces: **Wipe items such as lamps or decor with a microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or dust and use a multi-surface cleaner to remove any residue. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. For hard to reach places such as ceiling fans or high shelves, use an extendable duster. Start from the highest surfaces and work your way to the bottom.

**Wipe high-touch areas with disinfectant**: Wipe all high-touch areas with a microfiber cloth soaked in disinfectant or a disinfectant wipe. High-touch areas include doorknobs, light switches, televisions and remotes, tables, and shelf surfaces.

**Vacuum soft surfaces**: Vacuum all soft items such as rugs and carpeted areas as well as other furniture with textile surfaces such as sofas. Spot clean textiles using a water and detergent solution and a bristle brush.

**Clean the floor**: Sweep all non-carpeted areas, then mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution. Pay extra attention to corners or sides of the walls. When cleaning the floor using a vacuum or by sweeping, make sure to get areas under the bed or other large furniture.

**Clean windows and glass**: Working from the highest point to the lowest, clean all windows and glass with a glass cleaner spray and microfiber towel.

A dirty bathroom will turn guests off immediately. Bathrooms are breeding grounds for germs, so ensure to sanitize doorknobs, handles, and other hardware before you begin the cleaning process. Follow the steps below when cleaning the bathroom:

**Wash all linens: **Remove all dirty linens, towels, and shower curtains and put them in a laundry bag to prevent the spread of germs. Wash them on a high heat setting.

**Remove items from the bathroom**: Collect all portable bathroom supplies such as toiletries, soaps, and the hair dryer. Throw away all disposable items offered to guests. For non-disposable items, wipe with a multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Put the items aside while cleaning the rest of the room and replace when finished. Finally, empty all garbage cans.

**Clean the toilet: **Spray the surface of the toilet as well as the inside of the bowl with a multi-surface cleaner. Be sure you allow for the solution to set according to the time specified on the product label. Use a toilet brush to clean inside the toilet bowl. Once clean, hold the brush over the toilet bowl and pour bleach over the brush. Let the bleach set for a couple of minutes, then pour water over the brush into the toilet bowl and flush.

**Clean all bathroom surfaces and high-touch areas:** Spray all hard surfaces such as the bathtub, shower, sink, and tiled surfaces with a multi-surface cleaner and wipe with a microfiber cloth. Use a scrub brush if needed for residue that is difficult to get off. Work from top to bottom to avoid falling debris.

**Sanitize all bathroom surfaces and high-touch areas: **After thoroughly cleaning the bathroom surfaces, spray all areas with a multi-surface disinfectant. Wipe all high-touch areas with a microfiber cloth soaked in disinfectant or a disinfectant wipe. Put the cloths used to clean the bathroom in the laundry. Do not use them in other parts of the house.

**Clean the bathroom floors**: Sweep or vacuum the bathroom floors. Once all debris has been removed, mop the floor using a water and floor cleaning solution.

Kitchens tend to get messy after being used. You’ll find some guests will want to cook while staying in your short-term rental and others will only make coffee in the morning. Regardless of how the space is used, it’s important to give your kitchen a deep clean after each guest departs. Follow the steps below on cleaning your kitchen area:

**Empty all garbage cans: **Remove all items, food, and garbage the previous guests left in the kitchen.

**Wash all kitchen utensils:** All dishes, silverware, and glassware should be washed in the dishwasher, including items that appear clean. These items may have been touched or not thoroughly cleaned by previous guests. If you do not have a dishwasher or if there are items that need to be washed by hand, use soap and hot water. Remember to also wash the microwave plate and oven racks or trays.

**Clean kitchen shelves and wall storage**: Clean the shelves you use to hold your dishes with multi-surface cleaner and a microfiber cloth, then spray with a multi-surface disinfectant and allow to air dry. Only return dishes and utensils back to the shelves once it has air dried.

**Clean kitchen equipment**: Spray oven cleaner on kitchen appliances as well as the stovetop, oven interior, and microwave interior. Leave the spray to set following the time indicated on the label, and wipe with a microfiber cloth or rough sponge and water to remove any buildup. Use water to help loosen any tough buildup.

**Clean remaining kitchen surfaces and high-touch areas:** Clean the remaining surfaces of the kitchen with the multi-surface cleaner and microfiber cloth, and spray with multi-surface disinfectant and allow to air dry. This includes counter-tops, drawer handles, the refrigerator exterior and interior, the microwave exterior, and the pantry. Any remaining kitchen appliances such as toasters should be cleaned in the same way. Remember to unplug the kitchen appliances before spaying any cleaning or disinfectant solutions on them.
