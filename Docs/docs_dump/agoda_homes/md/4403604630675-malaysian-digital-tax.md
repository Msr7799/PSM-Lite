On 27 February 2020, the Malaysian government announced an economic stimulus package due to the current economic situation. In that package, accommodation service providers are exempted from paying 6% Service Tax to the government between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2021. This Service Tax is different from the Digital Service Tax which was implemented on 1 Jan 2020. Refer to this article for information on Digital Service Tax.
