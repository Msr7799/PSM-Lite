This feature is not yet available within the Host Portal, although we plan to offer it soon. For now, you’ll need to get in touch with us by clicking the **Contact Us** button in order to make this change.




You’ll need to provide the following information:

- Please put "Request for immediate location update for HID (xxxx) Property Name (xxxx)” in the subject line of the email."(Your HID is your Hotel ID)
-
**Latitude** (see below on how to obtain this from Google Maps)
-
**Longitude** (see below on how to obtain this from Google Maps)
- Detailed street address
- Area
- City
- State
- Country
- Postal code


Here’s how to find various details of your location on Google Maps:

-
Open
**Google Maps**. Please don’t use Lite Mode- it won’t give you the information you need.
- Right-click the correct location on the map.
-
Select
**What's here**?
- At the bottom, you’ll see a box with the info in it.
