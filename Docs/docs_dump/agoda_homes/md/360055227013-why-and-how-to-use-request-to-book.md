As a host, you have the flexibility to decide how guests book your property. While allowing guests to book instantly is highly recommended for maximizing bookings, some hosts may prefer additional time to review booking requests before confirming a stay. **Request to book** provides this flexibility, giving you the opportunity to ensure each booking aligns with your preferences and property needs.


**Why choose Request to book?**

**Request to book** allows you to manually review and respond to each booking request within 24 hours. This option can be helpful if:

- You need time to review booking details, such as the length of stay or group size.
- You want to ensure your property is a good fit for the guest’s needs.
- Your property has specific rules or requirements that may need clarification before confirming a booking.

This approach offers more time to manage bookings thoughtfully, but it’s worth noting that it may result in fewer bookings, as some guests prefer the convenience of instant confirmation.


**How to switch to Request to book**

**Desktop**

- Sign in to your account. If you manage multiple properties, select it from
**Listings**.
- Navigate to
**Rates and availability** **>>Booking settings**.
- Change how guests can book your property to
**Request to book**.
- Confirm the change, then click
**Save**.

**Agoda app**

- Open the Agoda app, switch to host mode, and navigate to your listing.
- Tap
**More **>> **Rates and availability** >> **Booking settings**.
- Change how guests can book your property to
**Request to book**.
- Confirm the change and then click
**Save**.


**Things to keep in mind**

-
**Request to book** gives you the time and flexibility to thoughtfully review each booking request. However, it may also reduce your property’s visibility and booking potential, as many guests prefer instant confirmation.
- If you choose
**Request to book**, clearly outline your property’s rules or requirements in your listing’s description to help guests understand what to expect before submitting a request.
- Install the Agoda app and turn on notifications to stay aware of reservation requests. Remember, these requests are automatically declined 24 hours after they are received.
- Always respond to reservation requests promptly. If you can’t accept a request, decline it quickly and consider including a polite message to the guest explaining why. This ensures a smooth experience and keeps the door open for future bookings.
