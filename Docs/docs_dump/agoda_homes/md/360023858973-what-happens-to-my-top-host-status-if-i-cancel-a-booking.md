“Bad cancellations” may affect your Top Host status. A “bad cancellation” is any cancellation made without notifying the guest. In order to preserve your Top Host status, you cannot have more than 3 bad cancellations in a 6 month period. This policy is designed to make sure guests have the best experience possible.


If the mistake is on our end, the cancellation will not count against you and will not affect your Top Host status. Contact us if you have any questions about a cancellation and please be as specific as possible about the situation. We will always do our best to make a fair decision.
