If your property’s reservation type** **is set up as **Require reservation requests**, every booking request will be sent to you via email for you to accept/decline within 24 hours, else the booking will be automatically cancelled. Please note that Book-on-Request reservations create a suboptimal experience for guests as they need to wait for a day to receive a booking confirmation. We encourage you to keep your property reservation type as **Instant book**. If you need to maintain an on-request reservation type, please monitor these reservation request notifications so that you can promptly respond to guests.

Once you accept** **a booking, you will receive an email notification from us stating that the booking is confirmed. If you decline the booking request, the booking will be cancelled. If you have missed the booking request email notification, please go to **Messages** on Host Manage to accept/decline the booking.

All booking statuses are recorded on Host Manage.
