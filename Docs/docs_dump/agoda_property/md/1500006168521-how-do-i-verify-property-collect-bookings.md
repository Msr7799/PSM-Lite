The first action you will be able to take once a Property Collect booking is confirmed is to verify if the credit card the guest has provided is valid. Clicking ‘Check if guest credit card is valid’ (1) will return an instant result and unlock further actions based on the outcome.

This action is available from the time of the booking until check-in date + 24 hours.


Customers whose credit cards pass this verification are less likely to cancel. If they do cancel and there is a cancellation fee due, charges can usually, but not always, be successfully made to the credit card. This feature is a customer-friendly way of checking if a booking is secure, prior to check-in.

This action is available for Property Collect bookings made with credit card guarantee, from the time of booking until 24 hours after check-in day.

If the first verification fails, you can request a new credit card from the guest or contact them via our messaging service in YCS.

No, if verification fails, you can request a new credit card right away.

This feature can only be used once. If clicked, it will be unavailable for further action. It will also not be available outside the mentioned time window.
