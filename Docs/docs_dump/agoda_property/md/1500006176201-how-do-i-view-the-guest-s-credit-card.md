This action is available from 7 days before check-in.


Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, is a set of requirements put together by major payment networks including Visa and Mastercard. You must declare your compliance with these requirements to view the guest’s payment card details. You can learn more about PCI DSS here.

This action will only be available if the guest's card verification has been completed. The guest's credit card can be viewed a maximum of 3 times.

No, Agoda's systems do not currently support the sharing of the CVV/CVC number of the guest's payment card.

No. Agoda's Property Collect bookings are strictly pay-at-hotel bookings, you should not collect payment from the guest’s credit card prior to arrival. We understand that in some circumstances you may want to temporarily hold an amount to secure a booking in high occupancy periods, however, this is not guest-friendly, and we advise against it.

You need to have a 'YCS SMS' number set up for your account. You can request this from Agoda Accommodation Support via the support widget in YCS.

If you do not accept the initial payment card of the guest, you can request a new one through the YCS extranet. We also recommend you message the guest to let them know which cards you accept.

It is not possible to view the guest’s payment card details more than 3 times as Agoda systems will automatically clear the data afterward.

If you choose to view the guest's credit card, you will become responsible for collecting any cancellation fees should they occur.

By default, Agoda attempts to collect the cancellation fee from the guest's credit card on your behalf. However, if you view the guest's credit card, Agoda will no longer attempt to collect any fees. This logic was introduced to avoid double charging the guest.
