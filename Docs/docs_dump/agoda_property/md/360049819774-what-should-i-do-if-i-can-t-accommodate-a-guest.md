Agoda offers **instant confirmed bookings** to customers, which means Agoda guarantees that a guest will be able to stay in the room at the property that they booked. However, there are certain cases where a hotel rejects the booking or is unable to accommodate the guest.

We highly suggest that all properties should honor all bookings if possible. Any rejection may:

As stated on **Agoda’s term and conditions**, you will also be responsible for all the costs that your guest might incur due to a booking rejection. You can see more details in Booking rejection costs


This occurs when multiple reservations are made for the same room on the same night at your property where additional availability is not available anymore. The two most common causes are:


When you fail to update the rate on the platform or you forget to deactivate a promotion that is no longer applicable, this may result in an incorrect rate being sold and booked by a customer.

You can also refer to the article **How to calculate a booking rate?** for tips on these calculations.


**Here are some tips for avoiding Double Booking/Overbooking**** ****and Incorrect Rat****es****:**


This may occur if you don’t update to the most current content such as property cancellation policy, child policy, or facilities. To make sure you are up to date, please find guidance on how you can update** ****restrictions** or **facilities**.


If you don’t close out your availability during a closure or renovation period, you may receive a booking you cannot accommodate. Please make sure to plan ahead and close your availability according to your renovation timeline.


Your decision to deactivate your listing on Agoda temporarily or permanently will likely impact bookings. Following Agoda terms and conditions, honoring bookings is strongly encouraged.

To avoid rejection of any new incoming bookings, we recommend you plan ahead and make sure to close your availability at least 30 days before deactivation.


If your hotel is not able to accommodate a guest with a confirmed booking, you should offer alternatives. It is important to act quickly to make sure the guest is not left without any accommodation.

For alternative accommodation places, we recommend helping organize transport to the new accommodation. You can contact you, customer, directly to inform them on these arrangements -- click **here** to find out how.

If you have issues contacting the customer, please request the Agoda Customer Service team to notify the guest. Kindly provide following details:

As mentioned, any booking rejection will result in penalties applied to your hotel.

Depending on what you’re able to offer your guest, the cost that you might need to cover is equivalent to at least 1 night’s average nightly value of the booking. You can find details here at *YCS>**Help>**Terms and Conditions**.*

This cost will be charged to your property later, depending on the payment method used by your property.


You can report it to **Agoda Accommodation Support** team via the Support widget in YCS. We will then investigate the issue and confirm with you on any solution we can offer.

You can choose the closest correct reason available under “Booking related.”

We would still strongly recommend you honor the booking if that option is possible, to make sure the guest will have the best experience.


Providing a suitable alternative is strongly recommended; however if no alternative is possible, you may cancel the booking and inform that you won’t be able to provide any alternatives to** Agoda Customer Service**.

**Agoda Customer Service** can be contacted via email at **biz@agoda.com** or by calling the phone number stated on the hotel voucher (depending on your area).
