For **existing Agoda partner****s**, please contact the Channel Manager that you would like to work with. Once the agreement is signed, you or your Channel Manager can send a request to Agoda Accommodation Support to connect you via a Support Widget in the YCS, along with the Channel Manager name.


If you are **not an Agoda partner yet**, please register your property first. Click **here**** **for instructions. You can identify the name of the Channel Manager that you wish to use during the registration process so that you don't need to send the request to connect afterward.


A list of Channel Managers that are able to connect with Agoda, is attached at the end of this page.


Normally, the Channel Manager should provide an error message if your update is unsuccessful. Below are the most common scenarios and how to troubleshoot them.

|
|
|
|
Did not pass system validation -- for example if your Single rate is higher than your Double rate, or any rate is lower than the minimum rate set for that room type. |
Depending on the error, generally, you can fix it by either correcting the data as highlighted in the error message, such as updating the relevant settings in the YCS Room Page. |
|
Technical Issue/Connection Error |
This can be caused by several unpredictable factors. We recommend you wait for a few minutes and try to send the update again. |


In general, a booking notification will still be sent via email from Agoda even if you are connecting through a Channel Manager. In some cases, you may receive a booking confirmation from Agoda but not receive that same booking via the Channel Manager system.

|
|
|
|
Channel Manager's Request API does not cover the booking period |
Please contact your Channel Manager for more information. |
|
Connection issue on Channel Manager or on Agoda |
Agoda will try to push the booking message 3 times for Hint partners. If it still fails, we will send the info via email to your Channel Manager. For non-Hint partners, the Channel Manager will have to send a new request to Agoda when the connection is restored. |

|
|
|
To comply with PCI Compliance and GDPR standards, we do not disclose full customer contact details. Instead, we will mask the customer’s email address. |
You can still send an email to the customer using the masked email address Alternatively, you can contact Agoda Customer Service to help you relay a message. |


The process is the same as requesting a connection to the new Channel Manager. Just send the request to **Agoda accommodation support**.


You can contact your Channel Manager for more information. If you need assistance with property settings, contact **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support widget in YCS.
