Given the current COVID-19 crisis, our data indicates a willing segment of travellers who are looking to book, but are reluctant because of uncertainty around future travel restrictions.

We found that this could be an opportunity to provide more bookings to our partners, thus the launch of this new campaign.



In response to the overwhelming success of this program and the positive impact it has on our partners and customers, EasyCancel will become a permanent program.

Until now, EasyCancel has been used on a temporary basis. The current version applies until 15 December. For properties that do not opt-out of the next extension, EasyCancel will apply to all existing and future bookings (no check-in date cut off). You can contact us at any time to request EasyCancel to be deactivated.


In addition to extending the program indefinitely, we will also be adjusting the cancelation policy to align with how other OTAs set their flexible cancelation policies and to make it easier for our customers to understand.


To advertise and improve the visibility of your property on Agoda, we will highlight properties who agree to join this campaign by displaying a badge with EasyCancel remarks for customers.

The badge will be as below:


We've made it easy for you to join this campaign! Should you agree to join this EasyCancel campaign, you can simply follow one of the options below!


If your property has received an email from Agoda with the subject line **“Introducing Agoda EasyCancel - supporting partners & customers”**, there is a link in that email for you to click and join.

If you have not received any email, we have also sent you an invitation via YCS. You will see this pop-up on YCS which you may click to join.

If you know your market manager, please reach out to them directly.

Otherwise, reach out to our support team by clicking on the **blue **Support button on YCS. They will assist you to sign up for this feature.


The cancellation policy will be updated to the current EasyCancel policy.


The cancellation policy will revert to the old cancellation policy set by the property before this campaign.


No, for the changes on cancellation policy to 1 day before check-in will be implemented ONLY for new booking created after 4 January 2020.


Unfortunately, this is not a possible option for this campaign. You may set that using YCS directly should you wish to do so, but no badge will be given as it does not fit the campaign criteria.


You can either find the invitation on your YCS dashboard or email us using the blue Support button.
