Please note that you have to be logged into YCS to make these changes, you can find how to do this here.

This article is available in; Thai, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese & Simplified Mandarin

This is a new functionality that allows rates to be added based on the actual occupancy of the room, and will mean that existing rates will be adapted to a per person occupancy format in the new YCS calendar. This will be available for YCS desktop only for the time being.

You may be part of the test roll-out on April 6th If not, you will see this change when rolled out globally mid-April.


**Example**

**If you have a room with a maximum occupancy of 5 and rates are loaded as single = 1200 / double = 1300 / full = 1400, the new YCS calendar will display rates as follows:**

**1 person = 1200 / 2 people = 1300 / 3 people = 1400 / 4 people = 1400 / 5 people = 1400**


All rates, allotments and restrictions that were previously loaded into the calendar will not be wiped, and will remain in place.

If your Channel Manager doesn't support occupancy based pricing, rates can be sent from Channel Managers using existing Full Occupancy Models. The new YCS calendar will display the updates from Channel Managers per occupant.

Rates will be sold as they were updated in the calendar, even if your Channel Manager doesn’t support Occupancy Based Pricing. If the Channel Manager attempts to get the most updated rates and allotment from Agoda, they will be able to receive single / double / full rates. Full will be equal to the rate for maximum occupancy.


To access the new features of the YCS calendar

a) Login to YCS as normal

b) Navigate to the calendar page by selecting "View" from the Rate & Allotment menu.

c) Select a single date or range of dates and click on the advanced tab on the right hand side of the screen.

d) Within the advanced tab, scroll down to a rate plan and then select "Edit Price Based on Occupancy"

e) You have now accessed the new features of the new version of the YCS calendar. Continue with one of the sections below to update rates.


**Note about discount per occupancy**: "Discounting" for the new calendar works by using the full occupancy rate as the base price. The discount % from the maximum occupancy is increased by the base discount % for each descending occupancy.

**Example**

**If a room has a maximum occupancy of 3 and the full occupancy rate is 100 USD and the discount is 10% then the per occupancy rate would be as follows.**

**3 People: 100 USD**

**2 People: 100 - 10 = 90**

**1 Person: 100 - (10 x 2 ) = 80**


a) Set a rate for the full occupancy of the room

b) Set the discount per unit of unused occupancy

c) The rate per occupant will automatically be filled in.

d) click save rates

**Note about discount per occupancy**: "Discounting" for the new calendar works by using the full occupancy rate as the base price. The discount amount from the maximum occupancy is increased by the base discount amount for each descending occupancy.


**Example**

**If a room has a maximum occupancy of 3 and the full occupancy rate is 100 USD and the discount amount is 10 USD then the per occupancy rate would be as follows.**

**3 People: 100 USD**

**2 People: 100 - (100 -10) = 90**

**1 Person: 100 - ((100 - (10 x 2 )) = 80**


a) Set the rate for full occupancy of the room

b) set the discount per unit of unused occupancy

c) The rate per occupant will be automatically filled in

d) click save rates

**Note about setting a specific discount per person**: A discount for an occupancy level can't be left blank, and can't be negative. It is however possible to set a specific occupancy level at a discount percentage / amount higher or lower than the preceding or following occupancy level.
