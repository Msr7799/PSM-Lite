The AGP program is handled in extranet under the ePass section. Please see the screenshot of the menu section below.



You will need to select the Advance Guarantee contract you want to see transactions details for. If only one contract has been agreed to and is set in the system, it will be selected by default.

The transactions displayed under a given contract are split into two separate tables on the same page:

1. Departed Transactions: these are the reservations benefiting from the Advance Guarantee conditions that have checked out and have been deducted from the Advance Guarantee Amount on check-out day.

2. Transactions Pending Departure: these are the transactions reservations benefiting from the Advance Guarantee conditions that have not reached their check out date. You can filter the transaction to appear in each table by booking dates, check-in dates or check out dates:


In the ePass drop down you will find "Advance Guarantee Transactions". Here you will see all bookings benefiting from the conditions of the Advance Guarantee Program, as well as the remaining balance of your property.



Please kindly your Market Manager for program extension.
