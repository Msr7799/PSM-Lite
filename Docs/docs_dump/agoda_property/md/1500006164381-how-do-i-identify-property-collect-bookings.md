We are displaying the payment method of your bookings in multiple places.

Booking Voucher

The voucher of a Property Collect booking will always read "TO BE PAID BY GUEST" (1) rather than "PREPAID".

The total booking amount is also the sell inclusive amount to be paid by the guest (3).

The nightly price breakdown will only include the sell inclusive amount that you must collect from the guest. This includes commission too, which will later be offset in ePass. (2)

We display the name of the guest that made the booking to have you know who to collect payment from. (4)

YCS Booking Page

On the Reports > Bookings page of YCS you will be able to filter your bookings by payment model (5,6)

The booking summary will also display the payment model as “Property Collect” (7,8)

YCS ePass Page

You will be able to identify Property Collect bookings in ePass by looking at the “Booking Paid By” field (9)
