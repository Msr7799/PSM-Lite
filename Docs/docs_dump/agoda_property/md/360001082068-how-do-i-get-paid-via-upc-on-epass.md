This is a payment method that generates a single-use virtual credit card (UPC) for you to charge for each payment batch consisting of multiple bookings.

Please note that Agoda UPC cards are restricted to be charged via POS terminals under 7011 merchant category code (MCC) only, Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, Central Reservation Services businesses.

It allows you to create one payment batch for multiple reservations and charge the whole amount from one virtual credit card. Since the card is single-use, the full amount must be charged at once.

If you are on UPC on ePass payment method, you will be able to see the “ePass” menu on YCS. You may visit **How do I log in and begin with ePass?** for details on how you can access the ePass menu.


First time using ePass? Unfamiliar with how it works? Check our interactive tutorial here to familiarize yourself with the tool in a test environment.


**1. **Select **Current Transactions** under the ePass menu.

2. Check the **Booking Transactions** section.

3. Scroll down on the same page to check the **Adjustment Transactions** section.


4. Click **Next** to view a summary of your payment amount.




5. Click **Submit** to be directed to a summary page with your credit card details to be charged.


6. Depending on your role, you will be able to see either masked card details or full card details. Tick the box to acknowledge that you understand the card can be swiped only once and should be fully charged. **Press OK** to complete the payment process.

To improve the security of your operation, the virtual card is only valid for 24 hours. If you do not charge the card within 24 hours, it will become invalid. We suggest you charge the card immediately for the full amount as stated on the summary page. |
