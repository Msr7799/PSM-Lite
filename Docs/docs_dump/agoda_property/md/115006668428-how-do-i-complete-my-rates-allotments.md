**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Will Agoda **immediately **start selling my rooms under the rate I set up?**

We will only start selling rooms you once your property is activated.

**Can I set up rates for just one month for now, as I’m not sure what the market will be like later?**

To complete registration, at least 90 days’ room rates must be uploaded. You can always make changes later if you’d like to increase or decrease rates.
