It’s all the information in your property listing -- including facilities, amenities, services, reviews, and pictures. It also includes additional information like policies, notes, and your property’s description.

The quality and completeness of your content will determine how many bookings you get. Travelers search Agoda every day for their perfect property. The accommodation they choose will most likely be the ones with the content that matches their needs, and what they are looking for in an ideal stay.

**Remember: For travelers, your content IS your property. **

Since most travelers tend to compare similarly priced properties when booking, each property’s content creates perceived value for that same price. Every item you include in your content might make the difference between getting a booking or missing a booking.

The Content Score is Agoda’s convenient overall measure of content health for your property listing on Agoda. You can refer to the Content Score at any time as an easy way for you to see if there are any areas where your content is missing and could be improved.

The Content Score is measured by combining 4 elements:

Property level content refers to the common features and offerings of your property that are **accessible to** **all guests**, such as swimming pools, fitness facilities, or restaurants. You’re encouraged to fill out and regularly update the information for all the following sections:

Hotel Facilities – Research suggests that adding more hotel facilities information can increase your bookings by up to 10%!

Languages spoken – Let guests know which languages are spoken by the staff at your property. This is especially important for attracting travelers from other countries.

Sports and recreation – Guests love to know what activities they can enjoy while staying at your property.

Useful information – fill out other helpful information travelers usually look for.

Room level content refers to the features and offerings of your property that are **available in each room type**. Room facilities, size, view, and bed configuration are key content for each room type. Make sure to update the following information:

Room facilities – Let guests know all facilities provided in the room.

Room details – Guests want to know more about each room type.

Photos are crucial to your content score, but more importantly they matter to travelers when they’re browsing which hotels to book. You will need:

Your child policy can add a competitive advantage to your property. It lets guests know who is allowed at your property, and determines which rooms and properties will be shown on the search page when family travelers search for rooms. If your child policy is inaccurately set, potential guests may not even see your rooms or property at all.

Your Content Score is displayed on your **Production Report**. There, you can see your current content performance and the breakdown of what categories of content should be added to improve the Content Score.
