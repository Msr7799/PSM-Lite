**How does it work?**

The booking and payment flow of Property Collect are based on Agoda’s prepaid model with a few exceptions:

- Guests will pay the full booking amount directly to you upon check-in.
- You will be able to collect the full selling amount from the guest booking Property Collect.
- Agoda will deduct the commission from your other prepaid bookings to avoid manual invoicing.


**What are the benefits?**

**Simple to Manage**

- Payment for both Prepaid and Property Collect' reservations can be managed from one platform in ePass. Learn more here.
- We understand it's important to you to be able to track your offset commission amounts. You can print out a booking statement for all payments that include Property Collect commissions.

##
**Easy to Get Paid**


- We don't need you to transfer money to us at the end of every month for Property Collect booking commissions. We will take care of that on our end by offsetting the amount you owe us against what we owe you for prepaid reservations. This way it's always you that gets paid.

**More Customers**

- More variety means more solutions. All guests that are looking to pay at check-in can now find this option, which can increase your booking numbers. Attract a wider customer audience, get bookings with longer lead-times, and possibly improve conversion.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How do I distinguish Property Collect bookings and Agoda Collect bookings?**

Booking vouchers that Agoda sends to your property will have information related to any payment needed to be collected directly from the guests. Please visit article **here** for further details on how the Property Collect voucher looks.

**Will I still receive pre-paid bookings after turning on Property Collect?**

Yes, if you turn on Property Collect, you will receive bookings under both Agoda Collect and Property Collect, --which means more guests, and more bookings.

**Will I be sent commission invoices for Property Collect bookings? **

No, our internal offsetting system will automatically deduct commission for Property Collect from your other prepaid bookings. This process replaces manual invoicing for you, however, you will be able to collect a commission statement from ePass on your completed payments.

**How do I turn on/off and change options for Property Collect?**

You may adjust the settings by contacting Agoda Accommodation Support via the Need Help button in the YCS.
