**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What if my property is tax exempted by the government?**


The law and regulations in different countries and areas may vary. If your property has a special status, kindly reach out to Agoda Accommodation Support via the Support widget in YCS.

**Why Agoda is not issuing the tax invoice?**

__A) Law__

Please note under local law, the property is required to issue local VAT invoices to guests specifying the room rate (Reference Sell Rate)

__B) Legal contract signed by Property and Agoda__

Under our agreement with your hotel, you shall issue a tax invoice to the guest (when they request) specifying the reference sell rate.

__C) Transaction model__

Please note that Agoda collects the money on behalf of you and makes the payment after deducting our commission. This is no different if the guest pays the room rate to you directly and you send the commission amount to Agoda.

__D) Role of Agoda__

Agoda is a “booking facilitation service/ middleman/agent” – legally we do not provide hotel rooms, thus we earn only the commission for our service. Under local law, the provider of accommodation service (hotel rooms) needs to issue a tax invoice to the guest.
