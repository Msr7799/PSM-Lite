**Change of Ownership Nature**

A change of property ownership happens when there is an agreement between 2 parties to transfer their management rights to another business/management.

In these cases, the 2 parties are responsible to discuss and manage the below issues:

- Decide on pending bookings ownership
- All bookings should be honored by the new/old management as all Agoda bookings are instantly confirmed.



- Clear all pending payment ownership
- Depending on the transfer agreement, parties responsible to claim payment for bookings will be responsible to clear any outstanding/pending payment prior to the transfer taking place.
- Agoda will not be responsible for any payment disputes between the new and old management.


- Brief on existing Agoda deals that would be carried over to the new management.
- If the old management has signed up with Agoda for any special programs or deals that should be carried over by the new management, the new management is to be informed on these deals.



**Impact of Change of Ownership to Partner Account**

Upon change of ownership, there will be some shifts in responsibilities and communication related to the property's partnership with Agoda. Some of the possible changes in the partner account will require you to reach out to our Accommodation Services team for the changes to be established.

We’ve outlined below the possible changes required on YCS and how you may proceed to perform these changes.

**How to Report Change of Ownership?**

To perform the above-required actions upon transfer of ownership that requires you to reach out to Agoda, see below-supporting documents or information our team will need to process your request:


**I am from the New Management**

- We will require you to send us a copy of the ownership transfer agreement before we are able to update the information for you.
- Written confirmation from the previous management is required to confirm that all pending bookings and payment issues have been cleared.
- Review the property payment method and inform us should any change of payment method, bank account update, or access be required.
- Provide the Contact Number and Email Address responsible for:
- Bookings alert (Reservations)
- Marketing
- Finance access
- YCS settings

- If the new management does not agree to extend the partnership with Agoda, inform Agoda so that we can process the termination of the contract.


**I am the original Property Manager**

- We will require you to inform the new management to contact us for further YCS information updates.
- You will be responsible to clear any outstanding payment before transferring the property to your partner unless otherwise stated in the agreement with the new management/owner.
- You will be responsible to ensure that all future Agoda bookings are honored by the new management.
- If the new management does not agree to extend the partnership with Agoda, inform Agoda so that we can process the termination of the contract.


**Frequently Asked Questions**

**There are future bookings, but the new management can’t honor these bookings. Can I cancel the bookings?**

Please be informed that rejecting any booking will create a bad experience for the customer and might harm both the property and Agoda’s reputation. We highly recommend you honor the booking.

However, in the case the booking cannot be accommodated, please be informed that you will be responsible for all the costs that your guest might incur due to a booking rejection. Find more details on the booking rejection cost here.
