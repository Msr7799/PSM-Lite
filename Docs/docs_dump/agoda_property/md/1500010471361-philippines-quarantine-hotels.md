**What is a quarantine hotel?**

Becoming a quarantine hotel means that your property will accept foreign guests and domestic guests who wish to use your hotel to complete the mandatory quarantine requirements as stipulated by the Philippines government.

Please note that Agoda will coordinate with the government of Philippines on specifications and requirements, and information in this article may change or be updated in the future.

Agoda will assist in helping to drive exposure for your hotel to potential quarantine guests.

Quarantine hotels will be displayed via a special link on the Agoda website from May 2021 onwards.


**How can customers search for quarantine hotels?**

Agoda will have a special funnel on our website to display quarantine hotels. This will mean that all hotels currently available as quarantine hotels will be visible to the customer, subject to availability and other Terms & Conditions.
