Absolutely, you can set different rate plans to offer different benefits, time periods, room types etc.

If a rate plan is no longer needed, you can deactivate it. Alternatively, if you have planed the active period of the rate plan, you can set up the time period in YCS too. Then the rate plan will be inactive automatically.
