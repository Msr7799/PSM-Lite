**In this article, you will find information about our bookings and how they get generated**

Agoda provides instant bookings to the guests, therefore you have to keep the rates and allotment up-to-date all time.

Included topics:


We list your property on our website if all of the below criteria meets:


**How do I get the booking vouchers?**

Once a booking is made on your property, the system will automatically send an email to you with the booking voucher. In case you are working with channel manager, you will receive the booking in your PMS as well.

You can also monitor your bookings in our extranet under **Reports** tab in **Bookings**.

Find more detail here about how to acknowledge the bookings.


__Important information__


**How is the total amount calculated?**

Agoda does not send any invoices. We deduct the commission from the total amount paid by guests.

Reference Sell rate = total amount paid by guest

Net rate = total amount without commission

On the right-hand side of the voucher, you can see if there is any other discount applied (promotion, rate channel)



**How can I reply to a special request?**

In case you receive special requests from a guest, and you would like to contact the guests you need to reply the provided email address under Customer Notes at the bottom of the voucher.


**How do I know if there is a cancellation?**

Once a cancellation has been made by a customer, the system will automatically send an email to notify you, with details of a booking and a request link to acknowledge a cancellation request.

The cancellation fee may be charged based on the cancellation policy that you set up.
