**What is Property Collect without Credit Card Guarantee?**

If your property has already onboarded to Property Collect, you can choose to offer our mutual guests the option to make a reservation without a credit card. The booking and payment process is the same as normal Property Collect bookings.


**Why Property Collect without Credit Card Guarantee?**

- Drive more bookings! Industry data supports conversion gains for "no credit card" offers.
- Appeal to new customers who like to book without a credit card! Several markets or demographics with low credit card penetration will be able to book your property.


**What are the benefits?**

Other than the benefits already gained from Property Collect, you will receive the following bonuses by allowing guests to book without a credit card:

-
**Expand to markets** and demographics with low credit card penetration and cash preference
-
**Increase bookings by up to 15%** through convenience, speed, and ease of booking
-
**Reduce the risk of no-shows** with Agoda’s *Determine Intent To Stay (DITS) *system

**How does ***Determine Intent To Stay (DITS)* system work?

-
Agoda will contact guests the end of the free cancellation period in various channels (SMS, email, application, and WhatsApp) to remind them and to confirm their bookings. Multiple messages will be sent until the confirmation is received.
- The risk evaluation system will be activated to start investigating non-responsive guests (the AI system will investigate guests’ past booking history). Agoda will automatically cancel bookings from guests considered high no-show risk guests together with the cancellation email to guests and hotels prior to the cancellation period is reached.


**How do I set up a no credit card promotion?**

Once you have Property Collect enabled with a credit card required for all bookings, you will be able to add overriding promotions to allow bookings without a credit card. You will be able to set up these promotions under the *Manage > Promotions* page.

- Create a new promotion using the ‘No Credit Card Required’ template (1)
- Apply type (2), sales (3) and check-in restrictions (4)

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How can I report if a guest is a no-show?**

You will have the option to mark a booking as a no-show in Bookings (YCS > Report > Bookings). Check out **What can I do if the guest did not show up (No-Show)?** to find steps for reporting a no-show.


**Why can’t I see “No Credit Card Required” on the promotion page?**

The “No Credit Card Required” option will only be available when Property Collect is active. You can send a request to the **Agoda Accommodation Support Team** via the Need Help button in YCS.
