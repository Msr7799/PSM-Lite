**In this article, you'll find out more about requests from the Finance team to update bank account details and see how you can set up a bank account in ePass and what details you need to look out for Agoda to be able to approve your bank account.**


Our Finance team is migrating payments processing to a new system, and you are required to update your bank account details. You should have received emails from our team regarding this change.

**Important Note:** Failure to update your details by 29 March may result in a delay in the payout.

The title of the email is **Email Subject: [Action required] Please update your Bank Account details in ePass ****// [AS - ****【アゴダ】《要アクション》貴施設の銀行口座情報を****ePass****にて更新してください****]**

The dates that emails were sent are:


To be able to submit payments via bank transfer, we will need to update our YCS payment page (ePass) to your bank account. To get all these details right, please follow the steps below while entering your bank account information:

**TIP**: After selecting bank location, you may click save, and the system will highlight any mandatory fields in red.


Fields to be updated:

After submitting the account details, the status will first be displayed as **Pending** until our Finance Team reviews the details and the ownership documents.

Required documents:

Once the account is verified it will turn to **Approved** in YCS, and you'll be able to start submitting payments via ePass

Note: In the case of a **Rejected** bank account status, please revise the details and amend that account first before creating a new one. Our Finance team will contact you to confirm which details should be updated.

Please note that you should update your current bank account information instead of creating a new bank account to avoid further delay in processing your upcoming payments. The process to approve updated bank details takes 2 working days in Thailand.
