All Property Collect bookings are confirmed by default. There are, however, scenarios where cancellation is made possible to you based on the guest’s credit card verification status

In case the guest fails to provide a new credit card within 48 hours of the request, or the new credit card provided is also invalid, the action to cancel the booking will be made available. Clicking ‘Request to cancel booking’ (1) will trigger a cancellation email to both you and the guest.

This action is available up to 24 hours before check-in.


The system is going to generate an automatic notification email to the customer when a booking has been canceled.


In case the guest does not show up at your hotels to check in, the action to mark the booking as a no-show will be made available. Clicking ‘Mark booking as no-show’ (2) will cancel the booking and trigger a cancellation email to both you and the guest.

This action will be available from midnight on the check-in day up to 72 hours.

If you failed to report a No-show within 72 hours, the function will be grayed out and you must contact Agoda's Customer Service to report the no-show via **biz@agoda.com****.**


You or Agoda will be responsible for collecting the cancellation fee depending on the actions you have taken on the guest’s credit card verification.

In case you have not used the action to view the guest’s credit card, Agoda will attempt to collect the cancellation fee on your behalf. Canceling the booking or marking it as a no-show will automatically trigger a charge attempt on the credit card, and an email to you with the outcome. If the charge is successful, the amount will be added to ePass.

In case you have used the action to view the guest’s credit card, you will be responsible for collecting any fees upon canceling the booking or marking it as a no-show. You will be able to get in touch with the guest via phone (3) or email (4) through the YCS bookings page



You can cancel a booking if the guest credit card is invalid or if the guest did not provide an alternative payment card. This action is available up to 24 hours before check-in.

No, you cannot reinstate the booking after cancellation.

If you have not viewed the guest’s credit card before canceling, Agoda will attempt to collect any fees on the booking. In case you have used the action to view the card details, you will be responsible for collecting any fees.

No, once a Property Collect booking is canceled, the commission will be removed from ePass.
