You can check your YCS user role in “**Settings>View Authorized User**”. If your role is the General role, when you click on a batch you will only see the last 4 digits of the Card number, the Card Holder Name, the Payment Status and the Amount.


You will be able to see the complete UPC and CVV number only if **your role is Card Viewer role.**



Don't worry! Simply contact Agoda Accommodation Support via the Support Widget in the YCS. We are ready to help!
