**New Amenity List**

Hygiene and cleanliness are becoming a concern for travelers now more than ever. Agoda has decided to add the list of facilities on a property and room level to better cater the guests' needs when selecting their stays. Partners are encouraged to update their safety and hygiene measures by selecting the facilities applicable to their property to reassure guests that their health is not being taken for granted.

The new amenities include:

- Daily disinfecting in all rooms
- Daily disinfecting in common areas
- Sterilizing equipment
- Contactless check-in/out
- Free face mask for guests
- Hand sanitizers
- Temperature checks
- Physical distancing
- Food delivery


**Display on Property Page: Hygiene Plus Badge**


Properties that fulfill the criteria of having the health and safety measures on the list will be awarded a Hygiene Plus badge on the Agoda.com website. The criteria are set by Agoda and may change depending on the demands of the health situation across the world.
