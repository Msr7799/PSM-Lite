Auto Top-up (ATU) is a feature on YCS to ensure that your property will always have availability to sell without the needs of going to YCS and fill up your allotment manually. This can help your property to reduce redundant works and save up your precious time. This feature will be made available globally on 1st of May 2020.

ATU is a feature that allows you to present minimum number of regular allotments that should be available based on the total number of rooms that have been set on YCS room setup page. If the number of regular allotments (on the Calendar page) goes below this number, the system will automatically top-up to this value.

By default, we set the top-up level to one room. This means that if your availability for a specific room type drops below one, we will add another room. We will do this each time the number of available rooms drops below one, until we reach the total number of rooms you have (based on the settings for that room type on the Room Set Up page).

You can activate ATU in the dashboard tab in YCS



Yes, you will be notified via email each time we automatically top up your allotment.

You can view these values in YCS. Navigate to menu: Settings > Room Setup. You will see the value under, under the Occupancy Settings.

No, if you close out inventory, the Auto Top Up feature will not initiate. To avoid any errors, make sure to close out the regular allotment, rather than updating inventory to 0.

No worries! This feature is not functioning with guaranteed allotment.

Auto Top Up is not available for channel managed properties.

If you do not want us to increase the Auto Top Up setting to **one** for all room types, you can opt-out of this change by contacting your MM or Accommodation Services Team
