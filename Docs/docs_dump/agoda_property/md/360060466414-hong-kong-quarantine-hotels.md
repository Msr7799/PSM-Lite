Becoming a quarantine hotel means that your property will accept foreign guests who are coming from abroad and have to quarantine when they arrive in Hong Kong

Please note that Agoda will coordinate with the government of Hong Kong on specifications and requirements, and information in this article may change or be updated in the future.

Agoda will assist in helping to drive exposure for your hotel to potential quarantine guests.

Quarantine hotels will be displayed via a special link on the Agoda website from January 2021 onwards.


Agoda will have a special funnel on our website to display quarantine hotels. This will mean that all hotels currently available as quarantine hotels will be visible to the customer, subject to availability and other Terms & Conditions.


Package Details: Customers will be offered a range of packages. The standard requirements are below:

Currently, packages must offer:

It may be possible to include additional benefits in your package, such as complimentary welcome minibar (with no alcohol), yoga mats or gym materials, extra meals (e.g. afternoon tea), free consultation with doctors, and other items that will make the quarantine stay more comfortable for your guest.


It is important to note that confirming quarantine bookings require additional steps. You should have already been briefed on the requirements by the government of Hong Kong.

Once a booking is received, Agoda requires you to:

Important Note: As these bookings are subject to additional conditions, Agoda CEG department will contact you 3 days before the customer is due to stay to confirm room availability and that required documents have been received.

Please communicate to customer in advance on any restrictions, such as not being allowed to go to common areas, receiving food deliveries, or visitors, or leaving their rooms.
