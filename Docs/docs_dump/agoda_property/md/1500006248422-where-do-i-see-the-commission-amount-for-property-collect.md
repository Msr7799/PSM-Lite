You will be able to keep track of your incoming and outgoing Property Collect payments in ePass. The *All Transactions* page will always display all bookings with the amount the customer pays to you and the commission amount Agoda is deducting for the booking (1).

You will also find the commission amount for completed payments on our booking statements (2) you can collect from the *Remittances* page.


No, neither the voucher nor the Bookings page display Property Collect commission. It is only visible in ePass.

The amount in ePass always corresponds to the commission rate to make sure you get the correct net rate on your selling rate. If you still have questions, you may reach out to Agoda Accommodation Support via the support widget in YCS.

No, Property Collect does not require manual payments to Agoda. The commission amount is automatically deducted from prepaid bookings.
