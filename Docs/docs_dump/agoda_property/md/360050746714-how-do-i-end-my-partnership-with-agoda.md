Any contract termination will result in **permanent deactivation** of your listing on Agoda.

Please note that once **permanent deactivation**** is completed**, we **won’t be able to re****store your ****listing** and you will be **required to register again** for future partnership.

Following Agoda’s terms and conditions, any termination requires:

In cases when you are not able to honor any outstanding bookings, you will be** required ****to find a ****relocation**. If relocation still not an option, you must compensate Agoda to cover the costs of relocation for those guests.


You can send a request for contract termination to your Market Manager or to the **Agoda Accommodation Support** team via the Support widget in the YCS.


Upon selecting **R****equest to deactivate property**, please choose the most suitable reason that best describes your decision so that we can use this information for future improvements.

To make sure we are able to complete your request, you will also be required to provide information related to:

Any outstanding bookings that need to be honored or provided relocation, as well as any pending payments to be settled upon check-out, must be **finalized ****before** sending any termination request.

**Until the last booking has checked out and payment is settled, your termination request will not be executed. **



As mentioned above, it is mandatory for **all**** confirmed bookings to be honored** before the agreement terminates.

It is important that you don’t overlook any bookings that have been made. Please follow the steps below on how to check for outstanding bookings.



To make sure that neither you or Agoda have any payments due, please make sure all transactions are finalized:

Until all bookings have been canceled and all payments due are settled, the deactivation cannot be executed.

Based on **Agoda terms and condition****s**, even after the agreement is terminated, Agoda may continue to market your property using inventory made available to Agoda by the third parties with whom you have separate distribution agreements. You may contact these parties directly with any further inquiries or concerns.
