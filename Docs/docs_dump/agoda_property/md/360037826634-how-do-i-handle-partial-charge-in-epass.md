**In this article, we will outline what to do in the case you make a partial charge. **

This article includes:


The card that has been generated from ePass can be charged ONE TIME only, therefore if you didn't charge the full amount of the balance, a partial charge occurs, you will not be able to charge the card again.


If you encounter the below scenarios, means you partially charged the card.

Submitted transaction as bulk but did not charge or authorize the card with full amount

Submitted transaction as bulk but cannot charge full amount due to POS/EDC machine limitation

The payment batch was not charged the full amount and the amount was returned to the Agoda card (Reverse Authorization)

An error occurred on the POS/EDC machine when charged, causing payment to be stuck; bank returned amount back to Agoda card (Reverse Authorization)

Contact your bank for details of the transaction status to find out if it was successfully processed to be returned or reversed

Status reverse authorization might take **up to 14 days** for the amount to be returned to the card

**After 14 days**, contact our support team via the "Help" button in the extranet to request to top up the total remaining balance to ePass




In cases when a payment batch has been created and the card has been authorized, even if the status has not settled yet, the system automatically considers the booking(s)** paid**. Reverse authorization also will not change the **paid** status

Sorry, the payment batch that has been submitted and created cannot be reverted back or canceled.

Cards that have been generated from ePass can be charged **ONE TIME** only**. **Please always charge** FULL AMOUNT **as stated on the payment batch.
