Reviews are moderated by Agoda to make sure that only verified and constructive reviews are shown on our page. Our goal is to make sure that all reviews on our site are authentic, honest, accurate, and constructive. And while we want all our partner properties to get the best reviews possible, we don’t remove reviews simply because they are negative.

Some reviews may be removed if they violate our Review Policy, which may include any of the following issues:

* *

If you come across a review that violates any of the scenarios listed above, you can request that the review be removed by letting us know on **YCS** through the **Contact Us button.**


If you don’t like a review you received, and it doesn’t fall within one of the scenarios above, we encourage you to respond to the review instead. Your direct response to guest reviews allows you to address the issues with previous guests while showing potential guests how much you care.
