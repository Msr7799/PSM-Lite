Previously, Agoda only allows customers to book up to 30 days. After conducting some studies, we found that a longer period of stays could create more bookings for properties!

We have added this feature on Agoda to allow our partner's businesses to expand with us. This feature will allow customers to book for up to 90 nights on Agoda for your property.


You will be able to manage the maximum number of nights available for bookings on YCS.


If you have received our email notification on the Long Term Rental promotion, you may click on the **"Create Long Stay Promotion"** and the promotion will be activated for 30% discount for bookings more than 28 days.



If you want to get the maximum advantage over your competition, we recommend setting your **discount at 30% for a minimum stay of 28 nights. **


Absolutely! You can deactivate the promotion anytime you like, simply go to Manage - Promotions.


Setting up the discount rate is totally up to you! We recommend 30% to maximum advantage however you can adjust it anytime.
