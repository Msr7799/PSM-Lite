**There are 4 payment method options that you can choose from to receive payments from Agoda. One of the options is using a physical card, also known as plastic card, or an e-Card. In this article, we will provide information about the e-Card payment method and how to troubleshoot any issues.**


This article includes:

The e-Card is a physical credit card or a plastic card that Agoda provides to you for charging all eligible booking amounts using the ePass system. Please note that Agoda e-Cards are restricted to be charged via POS terminals under 7011 merchant category code (MCC) only, namely Lodging - Hotels, Motels, Resorts, or Central Reservation Services businesses.

When you receive your e-Card, you will have to confirm receipt by contacting our ecard@agoda.com. You will receive instructions on how to do this when you receive your e-Card.

Your e-Card information will also be stored at ** YCS > ePass > My Payment Accounts **once it has been activated.

The e-Card that you received will not contain any amount until booking transactions have been submitted on ePass. Please charge your e-Card with the same currency and the exact approved amount to avoid undercharging or overcharging.

Your e-Card will also have an expiry date, please check to ensure that you only submit payments while holding a valid e-Card.

1. Select **Current Transactions** under the ePass menu.

2. Check the **Booking Transactions** section:

3. Scroll down on the same page to check the **Adjustment Transactions** section:



4. Click “**Next**” to view a summary of your payment sum.



5. You will be directed to a summary page with your e-Card details; please make sure the last 4 digits of the e-Card you have received from Agoda match with the card details displayed on the system and then click “**Submit**” to confirm.


6. Go to *YCS >** Epass > Remittances*, and wait until a new batch is created.

7. Once the batch has been created, you may need to wait for 15 minutes and up to 2 hours in some cases before you are able to charge your e-Card on your POS terminal.

8. You can then proceed to use your e-Card on your POS terminal.

9. All payments that have been approved will be removed from the current transactions page. These transactions can be viewed on the **All transactions** page for future reference.

10. If you forget to record the card details, or you would like to review the card and transaction details, you can view them on the Remittances page. Visit **How do I Review Past Payments?** for more information on how to access.

If your booking has been amended or canceled, Agoda will send you an amendment email (with “AMENDED” appearing in the subject line) with an amended hotel voucher or cancellation email notification including information about the eligible cancellation fee.

This updated amount will be reflected immediately for the relevant booking displayed on the current transactions page.


These are the 3 most common errors and how you can troubleshoot them:

|
|
|
|
|
Insufficient Funds |
Attempting to charge before the amount has been updated |
Please wait at least 15 minutes between approval and charging |
|
Bookings have not been approved before charging the card |
Please approve and submit booking transactions on ePass first |
|
|
Attempting to charge an amount greater than the approval amount on Remittances page |
Please make sure to review and ensure that you charge only the total approved amount for each batch |
|
|
Security Violation |
More than 5 failed attempts to charge the card |
Please wait for 1 hour before attempting to charge again, and make sure you charge with the correct details and a stable internet connection. |
|
Card Blocked FRE 10 |
Temporary block due to suspicious transaction |
Please note that a card will be blocked if you attempt to use the card for any activity outside of booking related payments. You will need to contact the Agoda accommodation support team and explain the incident before we can remove the block. |


If you receive any error message that is not mentioned here, please contact Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS.


You may dispute each incorrect transaction on the ** YCS > ePass > Current Transactions > Booking Transactions**, visit

Rest assured! You are still able to charge the card again with the remaining amount that has not yet been charged. You would need to calculate the remaining amount by checking the Total Approved Amount on the Remittances page and subtracting the amount you have already charged from it.

This error message means that your POS terminal is not under the 7011 merchant category code (MCC). We recommend that you always use a POS terminal with 7011 MCC; you may contact your POS terminal provider for further information on MCC code set-up. If you have difficulty changing your MCC code, please contact Agoda accommodation services via the Need Help button in YCS to report your issue.


It is important to understand that you are required to collect payment within the 150-day deadline. You can contact Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS for assistances.


You may reach out to Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS and request for a replacement card.
