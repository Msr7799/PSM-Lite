If your property has minimum age requirement:

1. Login to YCS

2. Go to Settings and click** Property Settings**

3. Click on **Property age policy**

4. Please fill in the details according to your property regulations

5. Click **Save**



Once saved, all information will be displayed on your property page under the "Property's guest policies" section.



**Can I set different age policy for different room types?**

Yes! With the Number of children allowed for free setting, you can set “free child” limits at the room level. Please refer to this article for more details.
