This new setting has been created to address your concerns regarding the limited flexibility of Agoda’s child policy support. This setting allows you to set “free child” limits at the room level.

This new setting ** replaces** the “Free Child Logic” field and both the “Default free children logic” AND “Respect the number of max allowed guests” settings (shown below). This field will be removed from the Property Settings section in favor of the MaxAllowedFreeChildren in an effort to provide greater flexibility to child for your property.

This setting is located in the Room Setup view within the Settings tab.

If you have enabled “Children stay free on existing bedding”, it will have certain YCS settings updated in order to fully enable effective child policies.

**Properties with “Children stay free on existing bedding” enabled and “Respect the number of max allowed guests including free children” selected**:

Updates include:

**Properties with “Children stay free on existing bedding” NOT enabled will now see the new field available with a default setting of Max Allowed Free Children = 0.**


Partners can now update this field within YCS by opening the Room Setup option in the Settings tab. This setting can now be updated for each room.


**1.) Access the Room Setup settings as shown below:**


**2.) Once in Room Setup, update the “Children allowed for free” field to the desired value for each room:**



This new setting is available to all properties, however only properties which currently have “children stay free on existing bedding” enabled will see any noticeable differences as part of the update.

Properties will now be able to indicate exactly how many children can stay for free at the room level. To do this, update the Children allowed for free to the desired value. Note, child guests in excess of this value will be treated as adult guests and subject to standard room occupancy constraints.

This setting will allow properties to customize the maximum number of “free” children per each room – and avoid situations where a guest arrives with too many children.

The following settings will be updated only if you currently have enabled “children stay free on existing bedding”:

Other minor visual / aesthetic changes will be made

**If you do not wish to allow children to stay for free at your property**, please disable the “children stay free on existing bedding” setting.

**If you wish to allow children to stay for free at your property, but want to exclude this benefit from certain rooms**, set the Children allowed for free to “0” for the specified room.

**If you do not wish to allow ANY children to stay at your property**, please update the “Minimum Guest Age” setting to the desired age.

**If you do not wish to allow children to stay in certain rooms**, please update the “Allow children in this room type” setting to “NO”
