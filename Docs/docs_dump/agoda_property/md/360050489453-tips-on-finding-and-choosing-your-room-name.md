A standard room name shows the most important information when comparing rooms such as room type, class, location, and any attribute which is not supported in the room setup.

Examples:

By standardizing the room names, we offer more clarity for guests and avoid potential misunderstanding. The better the user experience, the higher chance you can convert potential guests to real bookings.

Thousands of standard names are **translated into 37 languages**, ready to use and ensure consistency across the website. These provide the easiest, simplest, and fastest way to start selling your rooms right away.


Check out some useful tips to quickly find a room name that suits your needs.

Search the **key element that you need** to have in the room name (e.g. "Deluxe Room")

Combine the key element with **another class/term** to narrow down the search results. The second term must be connected with the main class (e.g. "Executive Deluxe")


Add the **accommodation type** (e.g. "Dormitory")

We allow up to 100-character names, but do remember **the shorter, the better**! As the name gets longer, it is more difficult for your potential customers to see the whole name, especially on mobile display.

| Too Long, hard to read | |
| Short and Clear |


Some of the elements on the room names guidelines are available option on YCS:

**Find out more on the**** attached pdf below.**

*Most elements can be found under Settings in Room Setup or added using Rate Plans Setup on YCS.*



We know size does matter, but that’s not the case with room names! There’s a better place to show this information. Simply go to the **Room Setup menu on ****YCS** and fill in the blanks. When the room goes live, it will communicate its main points without overloading the traveler with too much information.


You can set up the information related to breakfast or promotion with better visibility! For breakfast, you can update the benefit according to the rate plan that is offered on Rate Plan page. For promotions, you can simply create it from the Promotion page.


As much as we would like to help you, room name is not the ideal place to show information about Single or Double rates. The reason is simple --we don’t want customers to miss essential information. If you show it in the room name, the chance is high it won’t be visible, especially when it’s combined with longer names. The YCS Rate Plan is the perfect place for this setting.


Don’t worry – our system is always designed to show the information needed while keeping the name consistent. If you’re sure there’s no better option on the dropdown list, then you can request a new room name by sending the request to **Agoda accommodation support **via the Support widget in the YCS.
