Allotment feature shows allotment status and availability for the property in each day. You can select the date to view allotment, close and open allotment, or adjust the number of allotment, or view and update rate plan from this screen.

Allotment screen shows the list of the property's rooms and its availability. You can tap on the room name to see the room details, change the date, or drill-down the calendar to select the date in the future.

You can manage your allotment by increasing and decreasing the number of the room, or scroll down to the end of the room list to close out all rooms and tap SAVE to save the change. If you want to discard the change you have made, tap Reset. You can also update allotment, close out each room, or update the rate in the room details screen as well.
