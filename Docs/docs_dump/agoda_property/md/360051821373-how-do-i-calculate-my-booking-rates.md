At Agoda, there are 3 different rates that you may encounter:


Agoda’s default rate load type is Sell-Inclusive, which is the total rate including taxes, fees, and Agoda's commission. We will then provide you information on the amount to which you are entitled with Net-Inclusive details, which is total rate after Agoda’s commission, including taxes and fees.

Let’s take a look at an example below to see how a rate is loaded on YCS, depending on the options selected.

|
|
100 |
100 |
85 |


There are 2 discount model types, which provide you more pricing options to show customer and boost bookings.

Agoda’s default setting would be the **Additive discount model** type. However, depending on your agreement or requests, your property may be under the Multiplicative discount model type.

If you wish to change your discount model type, you may contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS.


Before starting the calculation, you will need to check all the data needed:

|
Please note that if the promotion is set with “Stackable promotion,” multiple promotions may be stacked and applied to the booking if all the promotion requirements are met at the time of booking. For more information, see How do I manage my promotions? |


Since Agoda’s hotel booking vouchers will always show the total Net Inclusive booking rate to you, you can use the formula below to find the calculation breakdown by converting the data above.

|
Sell Inclusive |
|


Example Scenario:

|
1. Sell inclusive loaded rate |
|
|
2. 10% Stackable promotion + |
USD 100 - 15% = |
|
3. 20% Channel discount |
USD 85 - 20% = |
|
4. 15% Commission |
USD 68 - 15% = |

|
Sell Inclusive |
|


Example Scenario:

|
1. Sell Inclusive loaded rate |
|
|
2. 10% promotion + |
USD 100 - 35% = |
|
3. 15% Commission |
USD 65 - 15% = |


You may contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS to request applying a different rate load type to match your requirement.

Please note even if a rate load type is updated to match your requirement, calculation on the booking voucher will still be under the Inclusive rate, which included taxes and fees.


Before reporting, please make sure that you calculate the loaded rate and discount when the booking is made. Any update after a booking is created will not be reflected in the existing booking.

If you have used the all correct data and still find the price incorrect, contact Agoda accommodation support via the Support Widget in YCS.
