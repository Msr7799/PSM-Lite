ASQ means Alternative State Quarantine. Becoming an ASQ hotel means that your property will accept foreign guests who are coming from abroad and have to quarantine when they arrive in Thailand

Please note that Agoda will coordinate with the Thai Ministry of Health on specifications and requirements, and information in this article may change or be updated in the future.

Agoda will assist in helping to drive exposure for your hotel to potential ASQ customers.

ASQ will launch in major cities like Bangkok, Phuket, Chonburi, Buriram with a requirement of 15 nights minimum stay. More cities may be added in the future.


Agoda will have a special funnel on our website to display ASQ hotels. This will mean that all hotels currently available as ASQ will be visible to the customer, subject to availability and other Terms & Conditions.


We will launch the ASQ funnel in mid-November

Customers will be offered a range of packages. The standard requirements are below:

Currently, packages must offer:

It may be possible to include additional benefits in your package, such as complimentary welcome minibar (with no alcohol), yoga mats or gym materials, extra meals (e.g. afternoon tea), free consultation with doctors, and other items that will make the quarantine stay more comfortable for your guest.


It is important to note that confirming ASQ bookings require additional steps. You should have already have been briefed on the requirements by the Thai Ministry of Health.

Please communicate to customer on any restrictions, such as not being allowed to go to common areas, receiving food deliveries or visitors, or leaving their rooms.
