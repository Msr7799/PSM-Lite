**Frequently Asked Questions**


**Why one of booking shows unpaid in All Transaction but I can't find in Current Transaction?**

If you are on UPC on ePass, its likely that you have submitted this transaction but haven't charge the card we provided. You can go to "Remittance" and obtain UPC card to charge. Otherwise you can reach out Agoda Accommodation Support via the Support Widget in the YCS.
