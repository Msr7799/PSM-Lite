Whether the occasion is planned or unplanned, Agoda **strongly encourages you to honor** every booking that has been made from Agoda customers at your property. This means that every booking that is made, even during the closing period, would need to be accommodated.

Any bookings that can’t be accommodated should be offered alternative accommodation. You can find more detailed steps in this article: **What should I do if I can’t accommodate a guest?**

Please note that if you can’t provide any alternatives, you must compensate Agoda to cover the costs of relocation for guests.


To temporarily remove your listing, we recommend you to **simply**** close your availability** for the time required in YCS. You can visit **How do I manage my availability?** for more detailed steps.

If you use **channel manager or other connectivity support**, please make sure to update your availability using your designated connectivity platform. This is to avoid unsuccessful updates on the availability if you only update on YCS.

For properties under agreement with Agoda that include guaranteed availability or allotment, you will be required to request an update to your Market Manager or to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support Widget in the YCS.


You may contact your Market Manager or to **Agoda accommodation support** via the Support Widget in the YCS to request temporary closure. If you don’t have access to YCS or are not using connectivity platforms. We will help you to temporarily unlive the listing.

Please note that if you are using this method, you will need to contact us again when would like to re-live your listing as well.

Based on Agoda’s terms and conditions, Agoda may continue to market your property from inventory made available to Agoda by the third parties with whom you have separate distribution agreements. You may contact these parties directly with any further inquiries or concerns.
