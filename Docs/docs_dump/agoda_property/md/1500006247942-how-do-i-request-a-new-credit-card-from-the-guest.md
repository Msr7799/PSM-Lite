**How do I request new credit card details from the guest?**

If the guest's credit card verification fails, or you find the card details invalid upon viewing them, you will be able to request a new credit card from the guest.

- Clicking ‘Request new guest credit card’ (1) will trigger an email to the guest with a secure web link to provide a new credit card for payment.
- Once new card information has been entered by the guest, it will be made available in the YCS Extranet, and you will receive an email notification.

This action is available up to check-in date + 24 hours and Guests will be given 48 hours at most to provide new payment details.


**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What should I do if the guest does not provide a new credit card or if the new card is also invalid?**

You may contact the guest through the YCS messaging service. In some circumstances, you can also request to cancel the booking if the guest fails to enter new card details within the allowed time frame (usually 48 hours). Find more details here

**Can I request credit card details from the guest by phone/email?**

No, you should only exchange credit card details through the secure link used by this YCS feature.
