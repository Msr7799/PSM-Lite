There are several ways to report a No-Show for bookings, depending on the booking payment method. Agoda offers guests 2 payment options: AGODA COLLECT and PROPERTY COLLECT. Guests may select their preferred payment method during the pre-booking process.


An Agoda Collect booking means that Agoda is responsible for collecting the payment from the guest; in another words, it’s prepaid. We will then pay the property using the payment methods implemented for each property.

Upon booking creation, Agoda will send you a confirmation voucher. An Agoda Collect booking voucher will have a **PREPAID** remarks on it, as below:


You may also refer on** YCS Reports > Bookings** and search for the booking ID/list for the payment model as well.

You have 2 ways to notify us of Agoda Collect No-Show bookings: via call or email. Be sure to include the booking ID when sending the request.

A Property Collect booking means that the property should be collecting payment from the guest upon arrival. Agoda will then deduct the booking commission on ePass from the property.

On the booking confirmation voucher, you will see **TO BE PAID BY GUEST** remarks as below:


As with Agoda Collect bookings, you can also refer to ** YCS Reports > Bookings** and search for the booking ID/list for the payment model.


For Property Collect Bookings, you have the option to mark No-Show without contact to Agoda. See the steps below:


The system will automatically compute the No-Show charge for you.

No-Shows fees will be collected based on the cancellation policy attached to the booking being reported. On every cancellation policy, a no-show policy will also be included. The fees will then be transferred based on your property’s payment method.

Again, you may view the cancellation policy on the **hotel voucher** or ** YCS > Reports > Bookings**.

**On Hotel Voucher:**


**On YCS Reports > Bookings:**


To change your cancellation policy, you can find more details in this article.


Agoda will attempt to charge the guest’s card stored in our system once a No-Show is reported, given that the property has **NOT** viewed the guest’s credit card details.

Agoda will let you know if the charge was or was not made in the cancellation email. You may visit this article for more detailed information.
