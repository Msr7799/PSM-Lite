Bank transfer settings are handled in the extranet under the ePass section. To be able to charge bookings through Bank transfer, the extranet (YCS) needs to be connected to your bank account.

You must first set up and manage the bank account to which you will receive payments. The bank account has to be approved by Agoda Finance before you will be able to receive payments.

Once you have provided your bank account details to us via YCS, the status of the account will be displayed as Pending. You then need to provide supporting documents to the Agoda Finance team via email (Biz@agoda.com), once bank account details and supporting documents have been verified by the Agoda finance team, your bank account status will be changed to Approved, and you can now start charging for your bookings.

The step-by-step guide on how to set up your bank account can be foundin **How do I Set Up my Bank Account in ePass?**

1. Select **Current Transactions** under the ePass menu


2. Check the **Booking Transactions**


3. Scroll down on the same page to check the **Adjustment Transactions**


4. Click “**Next**” to view a summary of your payment amount.



5. You will now receive an auto-generated message to check the bank account details set up in ePass. You should not change your approved bank account at this time, as this will result in a delay in payment settlement. Please press “**Submit**.”


6. You will see another message indicating that the payment will be settled and the amount will be sent to your bank account within 10 business days. Please press **Settle **to complete the payment.

7. All payments that have been approved will be removed from the current transactions page. These transactions can be viewed on the **All transactions** page for your future reference.

8. If you would like to review the transaction details, you can view them in the Remittances page. There you will also see the “value date” which tells you when the payment will be received in your bank account. Visit **How do I Review Past Payments?** for more information on how to access the remittance page.

If your booking has been amended or canceled, Agoda will send you an amendment email (with “AMENDED” appearing in the subject line) with an amended hotel voucher or cancellation email notification, including information about the eligible cancellation fee.

This updated amount will be reflected immediately for the relevant booking displayed on the current transactions page.


Please ensure that the registered bank account has “**Approved**” status.

You may dispute each incorrect transaction on the ** YCS > ePass > Current Transactions > Booking Transactions.** Visit

It is important to understand that you are required to collect payment within the 150-day deadline. You can contact Agoda accommodation support via the Need Help button in YCS for assistance
