Now we can generate the contract on Agoda directly and you can accept the contract immediately through a **one-click solution** -- without waiting for approval.

Once you complete first 5 steps of registration (and the boxes have become green) and passed the fraud check conducted by us, you will be able to see the Contract box in blue, which means the contract is ready for you to sign.

1. Simply click Contract box


2. On this page, you can check conditions such as contracted commission, rate type, and details of the contract itself. You can also save the contract in PDF format. After you click agree on the terms and conditions, the Accept button will become active. Once you click the Accept button, the contract is signed.

If you need an offline contract, you can request one via our Agoda Accommodation Support team via the Support button in YCS. |
