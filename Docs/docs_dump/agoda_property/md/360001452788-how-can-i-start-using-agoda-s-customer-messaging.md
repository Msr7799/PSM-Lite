Agoda's Customer Messaging is a platform that enables you to interact with guests. Enabling this service will allow guests to send a message to you before, during or after making a booking. You can check the messages both in YCS or in the email.

**You can simply send a request to the Agoda accommodation support team via the Support button in YCS. **


1. Go to Reports > Bookings

2. Go to the booking and select "Contact guest"

The message the customer send to you will also be sent to your email as per your setting in YCS Contacts page. You can simply reply to the email. If the message is a special request from a customer, you can also use One-Click reply function to send a response on your behalf.

Below is One-Click Reply function


Here is how the response looks like when you select each reply:

1. Subject to availability
