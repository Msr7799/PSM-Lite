**What is the minimum night for stay-through?**

To help property secure better occupancy during the peak period, we have implemented Minimum Length of Stay Through. This function allows users to set a minimum length of stay by specifying the number of nights that must be booked for stays that include the restriction day (e.g. Monday) in any part of the stay date range.


**What is the difference between Min LOS and Min Night for Stay-Through?**

-
**Min LOS** - applies only on the arrival date
-
**Min Night for Stay-Through** - applies on stay period, meaning any stay date that arrives or touches this min stay through, the booking will be abided by the rules of that night to the entire stay

For example, if the property set a restriction on Friday, Jan 1st.

-
**Min LOS** - applies only on to bookings checking-in/arriving on Fri Jan 1st.
-
**Min Night for Stay-Through** - applies to any booking that includes Fri, Jan 1st (but not bookings checking out on Jan 1st)
